    <string name="begtext">Before we begin this training, I would like to talk briefly about how to take it. That is, the instructions. The MOST IMPORTANT thing to do is to incorporate all of the theory from the training PASTE by PASTE, because that is the only way you will succeed and get the most out of what is in this training. And also, do not \"swallow\" the text, and pass it through yourself, that is, read thoughtfully. For me personally, this method worked, and it is proven by science. You\'ll read about it more than once during training and you\'ll see plenty of evidence later. The main thing is just accept it as a fact or as a non-breaking rule. That\'s enough. Good luck on your way to success\!</string>

    <string name="d1d1">"Before I begin, I would like to philosophize a little to clarify some points related to self-discipline. Because many of you may start reading these lessons and think that discipline is something negative, something difficult. You probably think that discipline is some kind of story about prohibitions and restrictions. The thing is, discipline is just a tool, a tool that can be used for different purposes. But in the modern world, it is used for other purposes. And that is why you feel an unpleasant shiver when you are told about discipline\? Well, look, even those who are disciplined do it wrong. For example, our parents, they are very actively trying to teach us self-discipline. As a result of this training, we literally hate everything to do with discipline. And do you know why this happens\? Because our parents have the wrong methods. They don\'t know what true education is. They only see the shell. Our parents seem to see Aha, a successful person wakes up every day in the morning, goes for a run, then does business, then learns languages, and spends the evenings with his family.\n""\n""And everyone will see this superficial information. But the problem is that no one knows why this happens. What is the inner history of this whole process. We sort of look at all these attributes and try to simply repeat them, but nothing happens. Here are our parents, they know what successful people do on the surface, they try to repeat after them. They, of course, fail. Then they calm down and think, “Well, we didn’t succeed. Maybe at least my son will succeed. Go, son, bring that, do it. It is not surprising that very soon we begin to hate everything that is connected with the discipline itself. Our approach to self-discipline is very superficial. It\'s kind of like buying a gold Rolex hoping to get rich, or borrowing a Mercedes in the hope of looking like a rich person. This gives the appearance of wealth, but does not give a real result. Therefore, in this training, we will stop running on top, and try to delve into the essence of self-discipline, to find its origins. After all, we do not think that a person\'s wealth comes from the fact that he wears a Rolex or drives a Mercedes.\n""\n""There is some deeper reason. And this is just an attribute. Similarly, self-discipline is just an attribute. A successful person is not just some machine that has unrealistic willpower to get up early every morning. This is a person just like everyone else. It\'s just that his system inside is configured somehow differently. His brains are charged with some other kind of fuel. We will not motivate and recharge, we will not scream I can. We will not pump ourselves up with emotions. This only gives short term results. It gives superficial results, it gives an attribute. This training is very practical. It is not designed for those who want a blow to the head. It is designed for those who are ready to tighten a few nuts in their head very precisely so that the whole mechanism works correctly. But before you tighten these two nuts, you will have to thoroughly understand all the mechanisms. This is probably the most important thing to know when starting this training. But there is one more point that I would like to touch upon before we start learning. And it is connected with the basic state, with basic motivation.\n""\n""In general, there are two states in which one can live life. The first state is called from under the kick. This is when your parents force you to do something, and you can even become disciplined. As a result of these actions, you can actually wake up every morning, bring them this or that, you can do your homework, and so on. But it\'s more like hard labor, because motivation comes from outside. Your parents give you a ready decision that you must do this, otherwise you won\'t get a computer, otherwise there will be problems. First, this is hard labor for parents, then hard labor for teachers, at school, then for teachers at the university, then hard labor for a foreman in the army, and then hard labor for money. And then the circle closes and hard labor begins for their own children. And all this is done from under the kick. This is also called debt. Have you noticed since childhood that parents convince us that we have a lot of debts. Here we gave birth to you, so you must. Then you owe the school, then the university, then the state, then the employer. And you owe someone something all the time. This is the deficit position.\n""\n""\n""Terrible position. If you live in a deficit and all the time someone owes something, then you will act out of a kick. You will always need some kind of external motivation. External motivation is duty. You must go do it. It is impossible to develop self-discipline on such motivation. You cannot generate your own energy. It will be hard for you to get up in the morning, go to work, and you will chase paraphernalia. You will buy a Rolex and try to look rich because there is only extrinsic motivation.\n""\n""The second position is the position of abundance. This is when motivation is born inside you. This is when you generate tasks yourself. This position does not require kicks from the outside. You get up in the morning yourself, you do the exercises yourself, you yourself burn with new tasks, and you do not need external motivation. You don\'t need kicks, you don\'t owe anyone anything. This is where discipline comes into play. The position of abundance is when you act in order to achieve the desired result. A deficit position is when you act in order to avoid an undesirable result. Feel the difference\? That is, in fact, the issue of self-discipline is a matter of basic motivation.\n""Do you want to get some kind of result\? Or are you trying to avoid defeat\? That\'s the whole difference. In this tutorial, we will learn these basics. Then reprogram your mind for the result. And finally, let\'s make sure that motivation is generated within us. I think this will be enough for the opening remarks. Let\'s get started."</string>
    <string name="d1d2">"When I talk to people about self-discipline, I often get misunderstood. People associate discipline, productivity, organization, and order with boredom. They equate it all to some kind of cage. It seems to them that discipline is a framework and boundaries that cannot be exceeded, but they really want to go beyond. In short, prison. And before I share my views on these things, let me tell you a story. One sunny day, bees fly around their hive. But let\'s focus on one particular one. The bee\'s name is Masha. Masha flies and knows no fear. She is doing well. She collects pollen, communicates with her friends and girlfriends and generally has a great time like any normal bee. Masha has dreams and goals that she would like to achieve in her life. She makes plans for her long life, she imagines what awaits her and so on. But suddenly a bear appears near the hive. The bear is hungry and is going to take the honey. The bear gets closer, and Masha, as a result of her instincts, pounces on him and sucks the stings right between the eyes. Unfortunately, bears have very thick skin. So when Masha tries to fly away, it turns out that she is stuck. Yes, now she has to sacrifice her baby to fly away. And so it happens. But, unfortunately, bees do not live without their sting. They die very quickly. The saddest thing here is that Masha had no choice. Over 1,000,000 years of evolutionary development, bees have developed a suicidal instinct in themselves to protect their home.\n""\n""So Masha purely instinctively attacked the bear and died. In other words, her fate was sealed. She herself had no idea that it would all end like this. Otherwise, it would probably fly away to hell, to realize its dreams and goals due to the lack of consciousness, the bee cannot control its actions. And she cannot be blamed for such unreasonable decisions. She is in the prison of her own nature. And here let\'s get back to the question of freedom. When I hear people talking about self-discipline as a prison, it becomes unclear to me, is a biological prison better\? Is it really better to indulge animal instinct than to manage your own life\? After all, a person, unlike bees, has the ability to surpass his animal instincts. Nature has endowed us with the ability to choose for a reason. If we have this ability, then we must use it. If we don\'t use it, then why are we human at all\? It was worth being born a bee, which does not even manage its own life. Do you have a dream to achieve a goal in business or proper nutrition, to gain some kind of physical shape\? Or maybe write a book\? Deep inside. We really want this to happen and dream of a certain life. And from where we are now to the final goal, there is a bridge, a bridge across a huge abyss. On this bridge, we meet a whole host of short-term pleasures that so beckon us with their attractiveness.\n""\n""But the more we frolic on the bridge, the less likely it is to reach the final goal. Fortunately, unlike bees, we have self-discipline. That is, we can overcome momentary instincts by crossing one bridge without being distracted by anything. Self-discipline allows us to achieve what is really important to us. We may not attack a bear with our lives, as bees do. So, in the light of our reasoning, can discipline be called a prison\? After all, if you think about it, we are in prison anyway, just in the case of self-discipline, this is a conscious prison. That prison, which corresponds to our personal interests, it is more like freedom. And in the absence of self-discipline, this is a prison of external circumstances that do not care about our interests. Therefore, the undisciplined person is one who gives up freedom for the dubious pleasure of being locked up in the prison of his own instincts. Of course, the modern capitalist world knows how much we love novelty and pleasure, so it showers us with the strongest incentives in the name of profit. So our consciousness and self-control is sabotaged not only by the inner animal nature, but also by the whole essence of the surrounding world. However, there is also good news. It lies in the fact that no matter how much the world around us and our animal heritage do not put pressure on us. We can break free from prison into a new world of self-discipline and order of awareness and organization. We have the choice to be free."

    <string name="d1d3">"Success is predictable. Success is not an accident. Unfortunately, losing is also not an accident, and it can also be predicted. Nature is absolutely neutral, and it only dictates its own laws. And the main law of success is the law, causes and effects. Success and failure have their reasons. This is very important to understand. Success works very simply. And it has three components. The first is to understand what you really want from life for real, what you expect and what are your true impulses. Secondly, realize what price you have to pay for it. I will tell you in secret that there is only one currency here, and it is called time. Thirdly, do not forget to pay the right price. And at this stage there is a divergence. Successful people want to pay the price and pay it consistently, while most people either don\'t want to pay the price, don\'t know what the price is, or pay it inconsistently. How do you know if you paid the full price\? Look at your life. Except in extreme cases in our lives, we see the result of how consistently and how much we pay the price. Here we need to clarify the most important point. The price must be paid in full and in advance. And here we come to the most interesting. Let\'s take a look at how self-discipline affects our future. Common sense is already on the side of those who know how to control themselves. But what does science and social research say about this\? According to the latest observations of scientists, the more organized a person is, the higher his chances of success. The child\'s ability to manage his time and resist impulse, to predict his future with even greater accuracy than an IQ test. Previously, the potential of the child was assessed in this way. The higher the IQ, the higher the chance of success in life. But now it is much easier to see how well the child manages himself, and everything becomes clear. Charles Wick, in his book The Power of Habit, writes Dozens of studies show that self-discipline is the cornerstone of personal success. Students who have shown the ability to resist their impulse have higher grades, more often receive degrees in more prestigious schools. They skip less than others and watch TV less often. Highly disciplined students outperformed their more impulsive peers in absolutely every measure available. The level of self-discipline also predicts how much a student will improve in their grades during the year. And finally, self-discipline has a greater effect on success in life than innate talent. In other words, self-discipline is the only indicator that guarantees you success. You can be talented, strong, wise, have great potential. But if there is no discipline, write wasted. But the word success is not limited to financial wealth and good grades in school. According to a large 2009 study, disciplined people are more satisfied with their jobs, regardless of other factors. That is, it does not matter rich or poor, thin or fat and healthy or sick. If you have discipline, you will enjoy your work. Surprisingly, that\'s not all. According to another study published in the Journal of Economic Psychology, people who are prone to order and self-discipline find it easier to find a job. Moreover, disciplined people have longer marriages.\n""\n""According to another study, on average disciplined people are healthier and live longer than others. Sounds too cool, right\? But it seems so only at first glance. After all, self-discipline extends to all areas of life, from the ability to resist a harmful cake, ending with the ability to work for a long time on a complex project. In his book How Kids Succeed, Poltavets writes, “Consciousness and self-control have proven to be the best predictors of success in the workplace.” But everything is not limited to this. Disciplined children excel in almost every area of \u200B\u200Blife. They have better grades in school. They earn higher salaries, commit less crime, and have longer marriages. What\'s more, they live longer, smoke less, drink less alcohol, have fewer heart attacks, have lower blood pressure, and are less likely to get Alzheimer\'s disease.\n""\n""There is another interesting study concerning children. Scientists studied a group of children, studying their ability to sacrifice a present reward for a greater reward in the future. It turned out that the longer a child can restrain himself, the better his grades in school, the more successful his career and life satisfaction. And what\'s more, he will have better health even after 40 years. Now you are probably thinking that you are completely unfaithful person. And since in childhood you were not very controllable, now you have no chance of success. Believe me, I have not always been disciplined either. But unlike IQ, self-control can be developed in oneself. This is what we will do."

    <string name="d1d4">"Self-discipline can make you a happy person. When I first came across this information, I was amazed, but I quickly noticed how true the arguments were. I traced different periods in my life and it turned out that way. When I am disciplined, I am happier. Was it just a coincidence\? Let\'s figure it out. In 2013, Wilhelm Hoffman conducted a study at the University of Chicago. The title of this study can be translated as follows\? “Yes, but are they happy\?” The fact is that usually, when we talk about discipline itself and give strong arguments in favor of controlling our own impulses, for some reason, the same answer is heard over and over again. “Yes, discipline is, of course, good, but are you happy if you have to control yourself and take care of yourself\?”. However, now it is safe to say yes, the better you control yourself, the happier you are. I have already said in previous lessons that discipline is not only the main factor for success in life, but also for its duration, and also makes your body and relationships healthier, but happiness is on a completely different level. However, why is it so\? Why is another 2017 study of more than 5,000 participants showing a direct relationship between self-discipline and subjective happiness\? Where does such a strict, strong and powerful dependence come from\? After all, this does not coincide with our usual understanding of happiness, right\? What they tell us: live a wild life, drinking wine,walk to restaurants, sleep all you want, do what you want and you will be happy, and also live a long pleasant life. In fact, it turns out to be exactly the opposite. Go to sleep and wake up on schedule, watch what you do and when, control your impulses, and only then will you live a long and happy life. This view of things destroys all the things that we aspire to under the influence of public propaganda. However, how can this effect be explained\? The fact is that discipline is not only deprivation. Deprivation always happens in the name of something. So discipline is more of a competition of opposing goals. Short-term pleasure competes with long-term success. Disciplined people have trained themselves to choose long-term goals over short-term pleasure. That is, instead of eating cake and lying on the couch. A disciplined person eats an apple and goes to work out. On the other hand, an undisciplined person does the opposite. I hope there is no need to explain what consequences it will get in the future. He will be overweight, he will be lazy and sick. Of course he will be less happy. And the longer he lives like this, the more excess weight. More laziness and more diseases. And, accordingly, one day you want to stop it, lose weight, start a healthy life, and so on. But habits are hard to resist. Hence the dissatisfaction. You kind of want to get better, but you can\'t. This is the root of unhappiness. A disciplined person simply does not feel like eating a cake. His brain is sharpened for long-term tasks. That is why he is happier. He does not have to resist the desire every time, to eat a cake, when he sees a cake, and next to it an apple, he takes an apple out of habit. Discipline is needed only once in order to accustom yourself to the right behavior. And when you have accustomed yourself, you do not have to limit yourself. The Dalai Lama said, “A disciplined mind leads to happiness. A cheeky mind to suffering.” And apparently he was right. Self-discipline is not about resisting temptation. This is when you can avoid it from the very beginning. To sum up, disciplined people do not deny themselves anything. They just want something else, and this other thing makes them happy. Our task is to teach ourselves to want something else.\n""\n""Another important aspect of a happy life is high self-esteem. And as amazing as it may be self-discipline. According to researchers and scientists, this is one of the main factors of high self-esteem. It stands above the talent of appearance, success, family circumstances and other very important aspects of our lives. It is discipline and the ability to control oneself that are the main predictor of high self-esteem in both adolescents and adults, and even in the elderly. Why is this happening\? Self-esteem is essentially self-respect. Self-respect comes very easily. If I justify my own expectations, then I respect myself. A simple example: You expect some kind of success from yourself. But if these successes are not, then there will be low self-esteem. But if expectations are met, your self-esteem grows. So, self-discipline not only makes people successful and prolongs their lives, but also improves relationships with loved ones. Makes us happier and increases self-esteem."
</string>
    <string name="d1d5">"In general, one can talk endlessly about self-discipline. For example, according to a 2005 study, scientists found that the more disciplined a person is, the better his memory in old age. Or, according to a 2000 study, disciplined people adapt better to environmental changes. They have better social relationships, fewer mental pathologies, fewer mental illnesses. And in general, in general, disciplined people are distinguished by better emotional adequacy. And in 2014, the Journal of Clinical Psychology published a study explaining why disciplined people are happier. As I said, in the introductory lesson, a disciplined person acts productively. His aspirations are aimed at achieving a result, while an undisciplined person acts reactively and tries to avoid negative consequences. There are a lot of such studies, and all of them are united by one positive effect of the discipline. However, in my opinion, the most important thing to understand about self-discipline is that it is indispensable. This is a unique quality of a person, without which success is simply impossible in any area of \u200B\u200Blife. Here I have studied many books on self-development and I know about 1000 techniques for achieving success. Yes, and many of you have heard about methods of self-development, about ways to influence your destiny. You know hundreds of unique stories and 1,000,000 working concepts, self-development. But it doesn\'t work without self-discipline. No matter what tricky technique you learn, no matter what you do, no matter how you develop, no matter what plans you have, and no matter how talented you are, it is all completely useless without self-discipline until you learn how to apply the doomed skills and talents, principles and techniques over time with constant perseverance and motivation.\n""\n""There is nothing to think about any success. Any business requires time, or rather, constant continuous investment, your time and attention. Self-discipline is the first door to be opened. As long as this door is closed, everything else is useless. The knowledge acquired at the university at work, in courses, seminars, in books and any other sources of information is not needed. Self-discipline is the key to everything. And do not try to replace it will not work. I can assure you. This is the absolute, the only and indisputable condition for progress in life. And without self-discipline, even the most gifted person in the world will fall below mediocrity. We can observe this both in scientific research and in everyday life. Yes, what can I say. I myself was a great example of this. That is why I hold on to the very discipline with both hands, for I have experienced in my own skin how powerful this tool is. He replaces everything. Why am I talking about this for so long\? Why did I devote four whole lessons, describing what good discipline is\? I just really want you to understand and feel that this skill is the only thing that separates you from success in any business. Master self-discipline and the whole world will open before you\!"

    <string name="d2d1">"Today\'s lesson is quite long and probably one of the most important. Read it to the end. And you can even take notes a few times. I really put more of my true essence into it than any other lesson. So thanks for your attention.\n""\n""A study at the Hong Kong University of Science came up with very interesting results. The students were asked when was the last time they resisted a desire. After that, 70% of these students indulged in pleasure that they abstained from. Well, for example, you refrain, for example, from marshmallows. A man comes up to you and asks When was the last time you abstained from marshmallows\? You reply two days ago. After that, you will eat marshmallows at the first opportunity with a 70% probability. But then they conducted a second experiment and subjects. A slightly modified question was asked: when and why was the last time you resisted your desire\? And what do you think happened\? 70% of the subjects did not give themselves free rein and continued to successfully resist the bad habit. That is, if you are asked why you abstain from ether, you have a 70% chance of not eating a marshmallow at the next opportunity. If you are asked when was the last time you abstained, then you are 70% likely to eat marshmallows. In other words, simply by being aware of the reason why you do or do not do something, you increase your level of self-discipline. I ask you to remember this thesis. This is the most important thing to know. Even during the Second World War, concentration camp prisoners were forced to take a cart, load it with stones and take them to the other end of the camp, then unload these stones there, then collect the same stones again in the cart, take them back. Unload again, load again and take it to another point again. Absolutely pointless work that has no purpose. It\'s like you\'re just dragging stones from one corner to another. And people went crazy from the absolute senselessness of their actions. For the first time, they faced such an inhuman experiment on their psyche and simply could not stand it. They did something completely meaningless, and it caused despair, bordering on a complete loss of reason. Probably, it would be better if they did something useful for their enemy. Yes, they would have helped their opponents and teachers even then. But this, although it would have a visible, understandable purpose, would there be an understanding of why you are doing this\? So, without a goal and a clear understanding of why you are doing this or that thing, no one can live and remain a mentally healthy person. And here we come to one of the most important aspects of the discipline. I have already said that discipline becomes pleasurable when applied correctly. What does it mean to use it correctly\? It means knowing why you are using it\? Energy is given to us for specific tasks. For example, to saturate your body, you need to eat a spoonful of buckwheat. But this is not so easy to do. You need to lift a spoon, collect a little cereal with it, put the contents in your mouth, chew and swallow. For all these tasks, our body allocates energy, and it knows very clearly why it does it. Problems begin when the body does not know why it needs to perform certain actions. The body may even begin to resist some actions if it does not see the need for them. Well, for example, getting up early in the morning is kind of not very pleasant. But, you see, getting up early in the morning to catch a plane that flies to the Maldives is a completely different story. So it all comes down to basic motivation. If the body believes in the reality of the prospects of this motivation, it happily wakes up every morning at 05:00, does exercises and releases energy for the whole day of the creative process. Therefore, laziness is a protective reaction of the body from those actions in which it does not see prospects. Here the body does not feel that it needs to do business. This means that he will not allocate energy to doing business. The body does not want to eat. So, the thought of buckwheat will not appear in your head.\n""\n""In nature, the end justifies the means. You can not force your body to plow for years on end without some very clear feeling. Why are you doing it\? So discipline is not the primary issue. The primary question is why\? And as soon as you can realize the true real meaning, which will be close to you and your soul, your inner deep essence, when you synchronized yourself with yourself, only then laziness will recede, then it will be easier to observe discipline. Without answering this question for yourself, you will never achieve the result that you need simply because you do not know what you need. Well, imagine you are going somewhere to go, but you don’t know why you are going there\? Arriving at the appointed place, no matter how beautiful it is, will you be disappointed\? And we are often wrong. It may seem to us that we know why we are doing this or that action, but most likely this is a mistake. Often we just copy someone else\'s meaning, some kind of imposed ideas. Every day we are introduced 1,000,000 ideas that have nothing to do with our lives. All these ideas are infinitely far from what we really need. And there are so many of these ideas, and the society is so rushing around these ideas. That it never crosses your mind to doubt them.\n""\n""There is one parable about the builders. One builder just drags stone blocks. He is angry and dissatisfied with his fate. He believes that life forced him to do what he does not like. The second is making money. He is also not very happy, although his actions make more sense. And the third builder is building a temple, a place where the gods will dwell. He sees this as a great task and with great enthusiasm does the same work as his colleagues. All three builders seem to be doing the same thing. But the level of awareness and motivation they have is completely different. The first hardly wakes up in the morning with burning eyes. Most likely, he quarrels with his family, swears at the state and is generally deeply unhappy. The second wakes up on an alarm clock and goes to earn money for his family. He sees it as his duty. And only the third found true motivation. He works for the state in exactly the same way. He gets paid the same way. He feeds his family in the same way, and he carries heavy bricks in the same way. But in his head there is another task. He created a certain meaning that turned his whole life upside down. Only the third builder wakes up with burning eyes. It is easy for him to maintain discipline, and he is happy. And there is only one difference. How well did he answer the question “why\?” The first builder answers himself at the most basic level. “That\'s all you need and that\'s it.” Circumstances force him. The second says: “Yes, this is my personal choice. I earn money so that I have something to eat.” But the third looks deeper than all. He is the most efficient of the three builders. He did not accept the ready-made idea that other people use. He looked further than others look: “After all, it’s true that I don’t just carry bricks. I am building a temple. It\'s unrealistically cool. It’s actually something out of the ordinary.” It doesn\'t matter how right he is in his beliefs. Most importantly, it is effective. You can be effective only if you consciously think about the question “why\?” So you go to work\? \"Yes.\" Why are you doing it\? “To move papers from place to place because the boss said so, or to make more money.” Or are you still doing something great\? The choice is yours. And how often will you ask this question\? The deeper motivation will be in your life\? The easier it will be for self-discipline. Therefore, we must make a conscious effort to look beyond these habitual walls of a small box, habitual social norms. It\'s actually very hard. You really don\'t want to deal with all this. It\'s like flying on a plane with all the people all your life, and then go down to the ground alone and go on foot. It’s long and incomprehensible, you can’t see the road very well and you don’t know at all where you will come. All your life you seemed to live on what was ready, on what other people gave you. And they were moving quite fast, but they were moving in the wrong direction. But if you want to achieve a result that others do not achieve, you will have to do what others do not. And you will have to think of something else. You will have to do different things and you will have to have different beliefs. It\'s just a necessity. If you do not answer the question “why\?”, then no matter what technique and self-discipline you apply, all this will cease to matter in one moment. There are many such examples. People strive for something all their lives. And when they get hit in a complete depression, they have nothing more to live for. Or a guy wants a girl. Maybe even for years. He taught foreign languages \u200B\u200Bfor her sake in order to appear successful, earned money to give her a present. He dressed well to please her. And so she got him. What\'s next\? All his meaning of life was dissolved. After a while, he will forget all the languages \u200B\u200Bthat his clothes have learned, end up on the shelf, and he himself will turn into a lazy dirty husband who watches football. And the girl, of course, will also leave him. What does it say\? The fact that the person was disciplined, did useful things, learned languages \u200B\u200Band all that. But for what purpose and what did it give him in the end\? People here now all indiscriminately want to be businessmen. But why\? Are they born businessmen or are they just delusional\? Most likely the second. I can give endless examples. I will even say more. 99% of people are really deeply, practically no one can answer this question, no one has a truly deep meaning of life, because it is difficult. Before I finish talking about this most important issue, I want to give my own example.\n""\n""I will tell you about how I found the meaning of life and how I answered this question. Let me tell you, this is just my personal experience. It doesn\'t suit you, just like any other experience of any other person. Don\'t make the mistake of following my goals, my ideas. I bring them just for thought. Just for the sake of an example. That\'s what I realized. You can, of course, answer yourself the question why, and even be completely satisfied with it. But, as I said, this meaning is most often on the surface. Someone put it in our heads. This is not a product of the inner essence, it is just someone\'s external idea, and it either does not work for us at all, or it works very poorly. For example, when you are asked why you take a cold shower\? You answer is helpful. And when they ask you why you earn money\? Do you answer\? Well, you have to live on something. And everything is in this plan, you feel\? It smells like a template, everyone answers the same way, and no one thinks about their unique task, although everyone has it. So, as I thought, I was asked why go to a cold shower\? I automatically answered This is useful. I was asked why make money\? And again, on the machine, I answered that you need to live on something. This level of awareness can be conditionally called personal. That is, all my answers did not go beyond the scope of my little life. And the level of responsibility, of course, was also small. Such goals do not provide motivation. Such goals are almost meaningless. If I do everything for myself and do not see beyond my nose, then motivation also does not extend beyond my nose. Then I saw an alternative and went beyond the boundaries of the individual. Answering the question “why\?”, I went beyond the boundaries of my body, beyond the boundaries of my family and beyond the boundaries of my comfort zone. Once businessmen were asked: Why are they doing business\? This question was asked to a large number of novice businessmen, middle-class businessmen and even serious businessmen. And the higher the status of the businessman, the more clear and correct the answer received. A simple person in 99% of cases says: “Oh, well, that\'s cool\! You don\'t work for anyone, you don\'t have a boss. It\'s so cool. Much money. Freedom, what else is passive income, yachts, loot, ”and stuff like that. Not everyone, of course, is expressed this way, but the essence is something like this. Give me more freedom, more imaginary independence, freedom from the employer, and so on. Beginning businessmen are already slowly realizing that there is no independence in business. It\'s the same job. It\'s just that before you had one customer - the boss, and now you have several customers - your client. Their rose-colored glasses are already starting to slip. And in response, they most often get something like: “Well, business feeds me. I\'m just doing my thing. I kinda like it. But when I create a big business, then everything will be trampled, life will be simple. I will have a bunch of subordinates, and I will sit in a big chair and drink wine.” Again, I\'m exaggerating, no one says that.\n""\n""Just for clarity, what middle-class businessmen usually answer. They already know that there is no freedom in business, the further up the ladder, the greater the responsibility. If you want your business to prosper, you must put your heart and soul into it. In short, shove. And there were only a couple of people who really deeply answered this question, and they were really high-level businessmen who created themselves from scratch and moving in a specific direction. Only in these people I saw the light in the eyes and the desire to wake up every morning and get to work. These are the only people I trust. Others didn\'t know what they were talking about. Their business fell apart very quickly. So, why go into business anyway\? The answer is simple - service to others. You create jobs and good working conditions. You pay a good salary, which means you make some part of the planet\'s population a little happier. You provide quality services and make the world even happier. Society is developing. You keep improving and improving your business. Thus, the effectiveness of your service to society grows. Ultimately, any activity, be it business or throwing floors, is a form of service. The only question is: Who do you serve\? What is your level of responsibility\? Are you serving your belly or are you serving all of humanity\? Remember, these are just my thoughts. You may well disagree with these settings, and I will even be glad if you do not agree, but I will still tell you where it led me. It is no secret that we live in a system, we are all interconnected. If any element of the system does not work well, then the effectiveness of this system is violated. A car can be assembled poorly, everything in it can stagger, and then it will only go a couple of kilometers before it collapses. Or maybe built like a Rolls-Royce. And not to make a single sound for tens, thousands of kilometers of road. So is the system. The more smoothly it works, or rather, the more efficiently each part of it works without interfering with the work of other parts, the longer it will live. Therefore, what is the sacred duty of each individual element of the system to work for the efficiency of the entire system\? And speaking humanly, each person should do so that everyone in the world is rich, joyful and happy, making every possible effort to this. If we put the question this way, then any activity is revealed differently. Business is just a tool. Business is the most effective use of one\'s talent for the benefit of society. Why do you need a business\? The key word here is, of course, talent or predisposition. And the second keyword is for the benefit of society. Therefore, from my point of view, people who are not naturally inclined to manage people should not even come close to business and managing people. Simply because he will bury his true talent in the ground. At the same time, taking the place of some other person who may be a talent in business and disrupting the efficiency of the entire system. So, answering the question why I rose above the level of the individual and began to answer this question in terms of the effectiveness of the entire system. Now, when people ask me why you take cold showers, I have no doubts. “Yes, it\'s very helpful. I do it for my health.” But this is just the first level. However, look, it\'s not just about my health. After all, if I am healthy, I will produce healthy offspring. And they will also give birth to children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren. And after 1000 generations, the level of health will increase exponentially. Thus, my simple trip to the shower is a matter of health for the entire future of mankind. And I\'m not exaggerating. So how can I not go to the shower\? What does it turn out that progress will stop on me\? Do not be this. I am responsible for my descendants. I am now at this particular moment shaping the health of the entire future of mankind. And you know, I really believe in it. How my eyes burn, you can\'t even imagine. But that\'s not all. If I am healthy, then I will live longer, which means I will be able to pass on wisdom to more people. And the longer I live, the more wisdom I accumulate in myself and the more wisdom I can pass on to others. And, by the way, to their children and grandchildren, and maybe even great-grandchildren. Thus, they will be wiser and will be able to bring even more benefits to the world. Right\? And so on. From generation to generation, the effectiveness of my journey into the soul will increase exponentially. Today I took a shower. And in 1000 generations my descendants will invent immortality. I am not kidding. But this, of course, is not all. After all, it\'s not just about the offspring. As I said, we all live in a closed system. This system endlessly influences itself. Going to the shower, I, albeit a little, but increase my personal efficiency. I become more cheerful. My mind becomes clearer. It is easier for me to work, my head works better and so on. This means that I will be more efficient in my work. Today, only a billionth of a percent. And after 1000 trips, such a shower is already 100th of a percent. And 100th of a percent is a lot, especially if you look at the scale of a lifetime. And do not forget also that I interact with other people every day, and these people become better thanks to me. They are part of the system, just like me. And thus the effect accumulates and, according to the law of time, returns to me with a vengeance. Do you understand what\'s going on\? I do not just go to the shower, I really decide the issue of health, wisdom and efficiency of the entire future of mankind. Yes, I\'m not just a president, I\'m the ruler of the entire universe. I decide fate here. You understand, I\'m going to take a shower. And this, without jokes, generates benefits at the level of the entire galaxy.\n"" \n""I solve this whole thought process with emotions and go to the shower. And you know, in the last three years I have never missed a cold shower. Do you know why\? Because I was able to qualitatively answer the question why\? And so with any business, if you want to answer the question of why and truly feel what human motivation is, you will have to go beyond the boundaries of habitual reflections. If you flounder on the scale today tomorrow on the scale of 5000 tenge per month, on the scale of bad good mood and health, you will not be successful. Well, I hope my example is more or less representative. I think everyone should think about it. Think about why in the end you do this or that\? Let\'s talk more about the difference between goals and meaning. We have always searched for a higher meaning and will always search for it. This is our nature. Once a person aspired to God, all his aspirations were directed to the divine. The feeling of God. The red line ran through his entire existence. Then God was replaced by communism, and people began to build communism. The whole society worked for one big great idea. It doesn\'t matter how realistic it was. Then communism was canceled and money was given. Now the whole society also believes in something. into the hand of the market, into acceptable costs, and into social Darwinism. It doesn\'t matter how real the idea is. One way or another, a person finds the highest meaning in everything. Like I said, it\'s in our nature to strive for something we don\'t have. However, these do not necessarily have to be ideas imposed from outside. These ideas can be formed by you yourself. And every person does just that. He invents a higher meaning for himself. To some extent, we are designed to make sense. A goal is just a goal. And the meaning is what fills our goal, paints it in colors, gives it beauty, brilliance, charm, greatness. Remember, I don\'t just take cold showers and I don\'t just go in for sports. Yes, the goal is to be healthy. But what is the meaning of this\? Why am I doing this\? And remember, the higher and the stronger this meaning, the greater your motivation to act. Therefore, it is not so important what goal you set for yourself, it is much more important to find a meaning, such as striving for God or building communism. Answering the question why\? Don\'t try to find purpose, try to find meaning. This is your lifeboat. I think there is no need to explain why I do not consider the principle of money as the principle of the highest goal. Or, moreover, I do not consider them as a meaning that can fill my life. The money is just there. I respect them and I love them. But in the modern world, money has taken a place in the highest value. They call it differently. Market hand, profit, interest, financial stability and so on. But in the end, it all comes down to money. Modern people simply do not know the alternative to money. And most people even defend their right to be ideologically enslaved by money. This is their right. After all, something must be in place of the highest priority of your life. Where you should strive and even money. However, money, unlike, say, communism, as an idea is not able to satisfy a whole range of our needs. The desire for money does not make humanity better. Perhaps one day we will be able to progress using money as the main priority of life. But at the moment people are too unconscious. To do this, money becomes the breeding ground for a whole range of immoral behaviors. But I am not a moralist and not religious to tell what is good, what is bad. I just don’t find such a scheme of life effective for myself personally. In my vision, almost all material things are either tinsel or a tool. An expensive car is a tool for certain tasks. And an expensive car in the hands of a person to whom this tool is useless is just an attribute, like those attributes that the natives put on themselves to look like American pilots of high-speed aircraft. The natives would not give him the strength to take him up into the sky like an American pilot. But external visibility for fellow tribesmen is preserved. And we just do live in a world of attributes in the world of natives who copy American pilots. A successful person goes to certain restaurants, sees a certain car, wears a certain watch, dresses in certain clothes, and so on. This is all in a pure form of paraphernalia, which does not carry any semantic content, it is not functional. Everything in nature is functional. In nature, that which is not functionally destroyed. A fat person is not functional, and he dies faster. A stupid person is less functional than a wise one. So nature gets rid of it. The same thing happens at the micro level. If you spend your life achieving non-functional useless attributes meant only to please your ego. Nature get rid of you first. Excessive fascination with trinkets, such as those that advertising imposes on us, is the path to an unhappy future full of trinkets, but lacking in content.\n""\n""In the light of the foregoing, let me summarize. If you want to fill your life with meaning, if you care what you live for, ask yourself. The main question is why\? Why are you doing all this\? Think about it every day and one day it will dawn on you. You will understand why you need a business. You will understand why you need to get up at 5 in the morning and why you need to be disciplined. Unfortunately, this knowledge cannot be transferred. It can only be experienced by yourself. It\'s like an epiphany. Some of you may be disappointed that I did not disclose the answer to this question. But not everything can be taught. You cannot teach a child to walk. We can only show an example. You can support him by the hand, but he himself must get to his feet and learn to rearrange his legs through a fall. So I sincerely wish you on your way to self-discipline, to find the most important thing - the meaning of life."

    <string name="d2d2">"In his large-scale study, named the main denominator of success, Albert Gray studied the habits and behavior of successful people and losers. And in this study lies the key to understanding self-discipline. If we shorten its results and express it in two lines, then this is how it will sound. Successful people enjoy the result. Unsuccessful people try to enjoy the process. And this is a very deep idea. Each person, according to the law of life, must experience and is experiencing emotions of completely different spectra. For every hour of joy, a person must experience an hour of sadness. The world is polar. For every plus there is a minus. Everything is always in balance. A successful person understands this balance. He is ready to experience tiny hardships every day, but get a huge positive result. At the end, the loser will be better off getting tiny pleasures every day. But a huge negative in the long run. A successful person achieves goals. The loser is trying to get rid of the tension. This concept can be illustrated with an example. Lunch consists of several courses. First. Second and dessert. Right\? Well, that\'s the way to eat. So, there is a golden rule. First you give the first dish, then the second and only at the end the dessert. If you start with dessert, yes, you will enjoy it immensely, but you will ruin your appetite. And you don\'t want to eat soup. Or second, think about what happens to those who have breakfast, lunch and dinner in this way. Right. He will get great pleasure from all meals more than most people, but in the end he gets a negative result.\n""\n""Will get fat, will suffer from stomach pains, will probably get liver and kidney disease cancer. It is unlikely that he will be able to run and walk with the same pleasure. How normal people do it. The most interesting thing is that such a person will soon not be able to enjoy either the first or the second, or even the dessert itself. Yes, because of such nutrition, the receptors of his tongue will stop responding to sweets and will demand more refined tastes, even more sweets in even greater quantities. This will generate dissatisfaction and a desire to eat more and taste better. He will not be able to afford it, because the doctor completely forbade it. But the irresistible craving will not go away. This will remain with him until he completely reboots his mind, body and soul in a diametrically opposite direction.\n""\n""It\'s amazing what unsuccessful people do. They want short-term pleasure, they eat dessert before the first and second course. Instead of working on a new project, they sit down at a computer or TV. This is how they curb your appetite. And the computer, and the TV, and chatting with friends, and entertaining - all this gives hyper pleasure. Like a cake. I ate a cake, chatted on social networks, watched a movie and I don’t want anything else. And as a result, a person suffers from a bad life, lack of success, bad relationships, terrible health, and so on. The main paradox is that the average person does not want to eat dessert instead of the first course. It is not normal for him to start his meal with sweets. Despite the fact that the cake itself is very tasty, we are used to eating soup or buckwheat first, although they are inferior in taste. It\'s the same with discipline. You just get used to it. Yes, a cheeky person will look at you with surprise, they say, how you force yourself to do all this. In the same way, the glutton is surprised how one can refuse a cake in favor of buckwheat. And we, on the contrary, do not want to eat sweets. What kind of wildness\? A disciplined person also looks at most people with surprise. How can you watch movies or miss social media when you have things to do\? You see, it\'s just a matter of habit. Bad habits are easy to form, but hard to live with. Good habits are hard to form, but easy to live with. As the wise man said, everything is complicated until it becomes simple. At first we were taught this by our parents. Remember - “Don\'t touch the candy\! Eat soup first.” When a person grows up, there is no one else to teach him. So either you teach yourself and your body on your own, or life becomes your teacher. And life can be a very tough teacher. She will not, like her parents, gently stroke your head. She sometimes teaches with kicks. And it hurts. So practice self-discipline. I say all this solely so that you understand the importance and absolute practicality of self-discipline. Discipline is generally the main law. A harmonious person is first of all a disciplined person."

    <string name="d2d3">"Our body is not very good at looking into the future, therefore, at the level of biology, it wants to follow the path of least resistance. This gives rise to a whole host of negative consequences. The path of least resistance is a very handy and useful tool in situations where mobilization is required, such as severe stress, difficult circumstances, unforeseen events, and so on. But in everyday life it is not very convenient. Especially in the modern world. The path of least resistance is a deep-fried sausage drenched in mayonnaise. Why\? It has a lot of easily accessible calories. Ate, sharply received a lot of easily accessible energy. In situations that require survival, such a sausage will save your life, and eating it will be much more effective than, say, an apple. But in everyday life, when after 2 hours there is another same sausage or any other dish on your plate, it’s not very good for your taste. It is much more correct to choose an apple and eat it. It gives less energy, it is more distributed and does not cause spikes in blood sugar. What is the advantage of this\? This is good for long term survival. But our body, as I said, does not think about the future in the beginning, especially in the modern world. Many do not understand that the modern human environment is a huge stress for the body. The metropolis is almost a war for our body - dirty air, bad food, stress at work, lack of nature. Compare life in nature and life in the city, where there is more stress\? And our body, as it were, feels a constant threat, a constant mental stress that just rushes from all sides. This flickering, advertising, headlines and shouts of people, queues, nerves, lights and so on. In short, our brains are in constant wild excitement. This causes our body to enter a state of energy saving crisis. And yes, in the modern world, the body will prompt us with decisions that are inherent in martial law. That is, eat a sausage instead of an apple, a cake instead of a pear. This, of course, does not only apply to food.\n""\n""We are also looking for quick profits. For example, ways to earn money invest and earn today, become a millionaire. For a week we are looking for schemes for quick earnings. For some, it takes their whole life to do this, and they will never be able to wake up from this fog. All their lives they will be looking for easy money instead of building a really worthy long-term project. And about this, the body tells him to make such a wrong choice, because it is constantly under stress. He wants a quick profit. He does not need long-term projects. In war conditions, the instincts that work in the modern world work at the level of survival and often deceive us. In the modern world, the body has learned not to look ahead, so it follows the path of least resistance. Naturally, this is not always good for us. The result of this path is long-term health problems, lack of career and motivation, laziness and all that. What surprises you\? “Tomorrow there may be a war, and you are wasting your energy doing some work\? Not buddy, go get some ice cream and then lie down on the couch.” How to deal with it\? Self-discipline. Yes, there are other extremely incredibly, very effective methods to improve incoming stress. Let\'s say meditation, retreats, nature walks, certain types of music, various types of massages, and so on. All these things work in synergy and in our practice of self-discipline. We will definitely address these issues. It is very important to be in nature. It is very important to be able to disarm. But to completely get rid of this bestial voice in your head in the city is simply unrealistic. So this is where self-discipline comes into play. Self-discipline is the ability to double-check yourself at the level of neurophysiology, retrain your brain, teach it to think differently, teach it to think the way you think. Self-control, order and discipline is the ability to give up pleasure in the moment for more pleasure in the future. The ability to match your actions now with what you want in the future."

    <string name="d2d4">"Let\'s think logically. Where does self-control begin\? The word self-control speaks for itself. When are you in control\? This is the most important thing to understand. However, not everything is as simple as it might seem. Usually we do something because of the pressure of external circumstances. Well, for example, Vasya thinks that if you do not pay off your debts, then they will take away my apartment. And he starts to do something. Why\? Because circumstances kick in. Can you call it self-control\? No, because the action is caused by external circumstances. Or a reverse example\? Vasya is too lazy to do work and says to himself that he doesn’t say hello to me, I’ll watch a better video on YouTube. It\'s the same here. Can we call it self-control\? No, because Vasya refused to work, blaming some external circumstances. He supposedly has a headache. But what is self-control\? Self-control is when you do or don\'t do something by your own decision and are ready to take responsibility for your decision. You either do or you don\'t. And you choose the decision yourself, without trying to shift the responsibility from your shoulders. Most people live with excuses. Justification is the easiest way to shift responsibility from yourself to some external circumstances that you allegedly cannot control. Most people don’t have the guts to say, “Yes, I understand that I have to work, but for now I won’t do it and I’m ready for the consequences.” Instead, we say, “Oh, my head hurts, bad economy. Ah, we didn\'t spoil the mood” and so on. Our brains are very resourceful in this sense. They can come up with an excuse for anything. For what\? Everything is very simple. If you\'re not doing what you\'re supposed to be doing, there must be a reason. If the cause is inside you, it is unpleasant and can even cause mental problems. Therefore, the brain, in an attempt to protect itself, shifts responsibility to the outside world. It is he who outwardly aggressive world is to blame that you do nothing. Calm down, don\'t worry, you can do nothing further.\n""\n""But you can go the other way. Circumstances do not control you, but you control yourself. There is a difference between me having to go to class - that\'s my responsibility and I have to go to class - it\'s a great opportunity to learn something useful. It\'s always a matter of choice. You can believe in both the first and the second. The only difference is who controls your life. We need to learn to look at the world correctly and stop shifting responsibility outside. Ellen Langer said in her book Mindfulness: When you have a choice, you have a motivation. That is, motivation, and hence discipline, appears only when you take responsibility for your actions, because in this case you have a choice. For example, you go to earn money not because you need to repay a debt or feed your family, but because it is your choice. Or you decide to give yourself a day off, not because the weather is bad, but because you decided so. Only when a person takes full responsibility for his actions and stops making excuses does he take the first step of self-control, as I said at the beginning, self-control is when you control yourself. And if you are endlessly looking for an external reason to do something or not to do something, then it turns out that the world around you, circumstances and other people control you. Ah, I was looked down upon. Ah, I live in a bad state and so on. Over time, your brain gets used to this kind of thinking and will look for excuses absolutely everywhere. Even where it is inappropriate. Self-control is a skill, and it can be developed with one simple exercise. Before you do or don\'t do anything, remind yourself that this is my choice. Realize all the consequences of this choice and do not shift the responsibility to other people, to circumstances, to your weaknesses, which you allegedly cannot control. And don\'t try to justify your own inaction. Just do it or don\'t do it, but don\'t look for excuses."

    <string name="d2d5">"One of the most frequently asked questions is: Why at one moment does it start to shove me\? I sharply want to run in the morning, take a cold shower, do exercises, do business, be creative, and then suddenly this fuse disappears, and everything seems to fade away, after which I slide down as quickly as I got up. I myself have had this problem before. And in general, almost everyone has experienced something similar in one way or another. I’ve seen enough motivational videos, I fell for playing sports, and a week later I’m already lying on the sofa broken and merges with the furniture and the surroundings of the room. What is causing this stuff\? Why does something light up very sharply, and then suddenly fade out\? Let me give you an example to explain how it works. Imagine an illness, let\'s say a cold. Why do some people get sick and others don\'t\? One person inhaled viruses, the next day he will fall down with an illness, and the second will continue to stay awake and work. All just their organisms are in different initial states. One has a strong immune system, the other is weak. The first one eats right, exercises consistently, does not expose himself to stress, meditates and often communicates with loved ones. The second one sometimes drinks alcohol, does not really like training, eats everything in a row, and so on. That is the reason in the way of life. One does something wrong with his body. Therefore, any virus makes him sick. Please note that disease is an abnormal condition. However, like any abnormal condition, it is needed to give the body a rest. When you are sick, you do not want to eat. So your food system is resting. You rest, fight viruses and so on. That is, it is a kind of respite for the body. The disease is objectively necessary for our body. So any abnormal condition is a consequence of our daily activities. In order to solve problems that are not solved during this very daily activity. And now it is necessary to understand a very simple thing.\n""That\'s when you suddenly start to shove something, you suddenly want to do something, go somewhere, achieve something. And suddenly lights up with ideas. This is an anomalous condition. The problem is that no normal organism can live in a permanent abnormal state. It always bounces back or dies. Therefore, a sharp prukha passes just as sharply as an illness.\n""\n""If unexpected dust is an abnormal condition, then, as I said, it is the result of daily misbehavior. And it is necessary in order to solve those tasks that are not solved daily. Well, look, you are given some kind of strength, strength for self-realization, strength for playing sports, strength for opening your own business, strength for being an excellent student, and so on. However, at best, you do not spend these forces on anything, and at worst, spend them on some things that are harmful to yourself. What happens then\? Your body is out of balance. Energy has to be spent and spent wisely, but you don\'t. And therefore, when faced with a positive virus in the form of the motivation of this text, a certain trigger is activated and an abnormal state occurs. You begin to shove. The virus works only on those who mismanage their body and energy. Therefore, do not be surprised that suddenly wild motivation sweeps through you. It\'s kind of like a disease. You accumulate powers that you don\'t use. Then they break out very abruptly and end just as abruptly. Such cycles of dust are not good, this is a direct pattern of your daily activities. First you play the fool and allow yourself anything, and then you forget the weekly motives. First, you eat hamburgers every day, and then you are overcome by a week-long cold.\n""\n""Everything is very simple and consistent. The human body cannot be in an abnormal state. Any abnormal condition is your body\'s emergency button. So you can’t just become a super productive person for the rest of your life just on a wave of sharp motivation. Your body is not used to this. It has not built its own resource systems, so it will become loose very quickly under this regime. Understand correctly, if you want to experience such a state, you will constantly have to go towards this gradually, day by day we cultivate the right habits in ourselves, the right mindset and performing the right actions day by day step by step, you need to accustom your body, do for it this is the norm. Here we can again draw an analogy with the disease. For example, what a 15 year old guy calls a disease is the norm for some 80 year old man. Why\? Because the changes happened gradually, imperceptibly. The same is true for productivity. What is dust for you and motivation for me is the norm of the day, because I have been moving towards this for several years, consciously cultivating all these sensations in myself and realizing the strength that is given to me every morning. So the answer to this problem is hidden in your individual daily behavior in your lifestyle. Something you are doing wrong, somewhere you do not have time, something you do not complete. You do not use the resources that the world gives you. If you lead the right way of life and use the resources that are given to you, then your condition will always be of consistently high quality. And to be guided is on conscience. She knows best where you could be better, how you could be more productive, and so on. Listen, conscience, although it is not always pleasant."

    <string name="d3d1">"In this part, we begin to practice. Let\'s start with physiology. Try to understand what is going on. After all, these are fundamentally important things. Without understanding them, it is almost impossible to become fully disciplined. It is the understanding of these simple principles that will make you disciplined forever, and can also reset your behavior from absolute apathy to full productivity at any given time. So be careful. Let\'s start with dopamine. Well, first of all, what is dopamine\? Dopamine is a neurotransmitter. The thing that is responsible for the communication of nerve cells in the brain and the rest of the body. Recently, this neuron has been studied in great detail, and more than 120,000 studies have been carried out to study it. These studies have mainly focused on drug addictions and mental health. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter of motivation. It is generated whenever you see an opportunity to have fun. Let\'s say you notice a cake. Based on past experience, you know that if you eat a pie, you will be pleased. Therefore, the body, wanting to get this pleasure, produces dopamine. dopamine forces you to focus your attention on this pie. You just saw her, and now she is in your head. Pie\! Pie\! Pie\! And this applies to all pleasures. Namely, dopamine makes you want everything that you really shouldn\'t do. But in fact, it also has a downside. He makes us want to do everything else. The same from the desire to eat something useful, to a great desire to work out. In other words, dopamine is a kind of body tool with which it makes you want this or that.\n""The only question is how to make it work correctly for your benefit, for example, so that it motivates you to eat an apple instead of a chocolate bar, a salad instead of a burger, and get to work instead of sticking to your smartphone. Dopamine plays a huge role in the process of self-discipline. After all, what is the essence of self-discipline\? It is the abandonment of short-term pleasure in favor of long-term pleasure. That is, in fact, self-discipline is a matter of motivation and the ability to resist one\'s own momentary impulse. Scientists have done a lot of research. For example, in 2010, a study by Professor Ray Solon was published in the Journal of Neuroscience, which found a direct relationship between the concentration of wine in the blood and impulsive behavior. The scientist says: Every day we choose between a quick but small high and a long-term but big high. Buy an iPhone or save money for a business, watch a comedy or an educational film, and so on. We have found that excessively high levels of dopamine in the blood irresistibly, pushes us to short-term, but small pleasure. In other words, too much dopamine = worse discipline. Among other things, elevated levels of dopamine are associated with hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder and other types of impulsive behavior. However, despite the fact that increased dopamine really destroys self-control and makes discipline almost impossible. Just lowering your dopamine levels won\'t help much. Scientists have repeatedly tried to give the test subject a drug that lowers dopamine levels, but there were no tangible results. What\'s more, if medications lower dopamine, other bodily functions can also be interfered with. After all, Fomin is responsible not only for the impulsiveness of behavior, but also for many important functions of thinking.\n""\n""Excessively reduced dopamine is almost the same grief as increased dopamine, for example, with a lowered to. Man stops learning from his mistakes. All of our ability to learn is tied to the new system. If a person eats a lot, they get fat and suffer, but at the same time they cannot stop. Rest assured, he has a badly configured new system. Most likely, he has very little dopamine or poor sensitivity of dopamine receptors. He is unable to learn from his mistakes. He is not able to perceive negative feedback and, as it were, passes it past his ears. But if it’s not enough just to lower or increase dopamine, if it’s not just about the amount of dopamine, then there is a third indicator. Right\? Precisely the most important thing is how our body perceives and assimilates the produced dopamine. Our body absorbs dopamine through special receptors. They are somewhat similar to the taste buds of the tongue. For example, if each dish is salted and eaten with a large number of sauces, then the sensitivity of the tongue receptors decreases. And after a year of such nutrition, you want to salt, retrain and transport food even more. Otherwise, the taste is simply not felt. Why\? Due to the fact that the receptors of the tongue are clogged and have lost sensitivity\? dopamine is similar to salt. If there is a lot of salt, the receptors of the tongue become clogged and the taste is lost over time. If there is a lot of dopamine, dopamine receptors get clogged or burn out. And we stop enjoying life. So we need to avoid new overloads and keep it at the right average. Why else is it important\? For example, in the matter of self-discipline, an important aspect is the subjective perception of time.\n""\n""With accelerated time, a person does not have time to do anything, and he always does not have enough time to complete tasks. There is no time for order and discipline. This affects the psychological state. Such a person becomes more irritable, it is more difficult for him to control himself, it is more difficult for him to feel the joy of activity, because he is always in a hurry somewhere and never has time to fulfill his plans. But it turns out that the subjective perception of time is very connected with the new system. What is the better sensitivity of new receptors\? And the more dopamine, the slower time passes and the more we have time. Time slows down, and the speed of the brain accelerates. But having high levels of dopamine is not good for us, for it leads to impulsivity. So our task is to keep the level exactly at the average level. But at the same time, make sure that the new receptors are extremely sensitive and that there are many of them. Once you understand the dopamine system, your subjective sense of time will be much better. You will be able to manage your regime better and will have time to implement all your plans. So, we have two indicators of the amount of dopamine and the sensitivity of dopamine receptors. We don\'t need too high a level. Amina We don\'t need dopamine levels that are too low, and we need sensitive receptors. So our practice will begin with the fact that we put our new system in order. Specifically, in the next lesson, I will tell you why you have too much or too little Amine and low receptor sensitivity. And also how to make everything beautiful. Go."

    <string name="d3d2">"To begin with, let\'s figure out how we can maintain the ideal state of the dopamine system. There is such a thing as dopamine baseline. The higher the base level of dopamine, the more self-confidence and stability in all manifestations. It gives a sense of strength, opportunity and personal power. But, as we said in previous lessons, too much dopamine is also not good. It can lead to impulsive behavior, tension anxiety and so on. Low levels of dopamine is the path to a complete lack of motivation. A person will not want anything, he does not strive to achieve something and go somewhere. For example, they conducted an experiment on rats, poured two portions of food, one large and the other small. The rats could choose between them, but the larger portion was fenced off. So to get to it, you had to climb over it. So, rats with low dopamine levels, unlike other rats, always chose a small portion of food and never tried to get to a large portion. They just didn\'t have enough motivation, although it wasn\'t that hard. Due to dopamine, you have a desire to reach new heights, move forward and develop. And with a lack or low sensitivity of receptors, you turn into a dull slob. So if we want to achieve great results, we need a stable average level of dopamine and good receptor sensitivity. However, this is only possible if we produce dopamine consistently throughout the day and in small portions. If it is produced rarely, say, a couple of times a day, and abruptly, and in large quantities, and in jumps, then the sensitivity of the receptors deteriorates, and the basic level of dopamine drops, and we become unmotivated. Dopamine surges lead to drug addiction, schizophrenia and other addictions. That is, a normal situation is when a person consistently gets high every day throughout the day from the simple surrounding world, from nature, from communicating with people, from completing the tasks that he sets and performs for himself, and so on. In this case, the base level will be maintained at a normal high level, and it will be easy for him to start the task, maintain discipline and enjoy life.\n""\n""Now let\'s talk about what prevents us from living like this and maintaining a stable and good baseline. Once an experiment was done on rats. Electrodes were connected to their brains in the very part that is responsible for the dopamine system. Then they were placed in a box and given the opportunity to press the button to activate the electrodes. That is, the rat runs up, presses the button and receives a dose of dopamine. As a result, the rats just hammered the button. They pressed it up to 1000 times. For an hour they forgot about food, sleep, water, about their children and relatives. All they did was press the pleasure button endlessly. This continued until complete exhaustion and the risk of death. That is, the rats were literally ready to die by pressing this button. After that, it took them about two weeks to get back to normal life and stop looking for the button. Later, the same experiment was carried out on humans. The results were repeated. It turned out that they were not happy, as originally assumed, but rather lived in depression, but experienced an incredible thirst, to press the button.\n""\n""Consider the function of dopamine. He is responsible for anticipating pleasure. That is, you want to press a button in order to experience pleasure, but in the end you do not get pleasure. So you press the button again. Thus, the mechanism of the dopamine trap was discovered. Dopamine traps work on humans just like they do on rats. People are not much different from rats in this regard, except that we are at least somehow able to analyze our actions and look for excuses for our inappropriate behavior. We also don\'t have electrodes in our heads that can generate endless, undeserved pleasure. However, instead of electrodes, there are other stimulants that create the same dopamine trap as the electrode in the head. We hit these buttons non-stop, and the dopamine base naturally drops. Decreased motivation to do something. At the same time, the subjective sense of time and, in general, the desire to live falls. Dopamine traps, swing the level of dopamine. The dopamine trap is when you do something just for a buzz, out of boredom with nothing to do, as it happens due to some very powerful stimulation. Our level rises sharply, drives us into wild excitement and excitement. And then it falls sharply down, causing shame and depression. I think you once experienced a wild desire to eat something sweet, comparable to sexual arousal. And after eating a huge piece of cake, shame and remorse arise. The same story with watching porn or playing in a casino.\n""\n""Thus, dopamine traps are all that cause hyperstimulation of the dopamine system. It can be drugs, pornography, sugary, fatty foods, computer games, visual pleasure, and so on. Let\'s call it a drug. And the person who does all this is a drug addict. If you look at the question in this way, then everything falls into place. Do you often see a motivated drug addict\? Me not. Most often, they are even too lazy to go to the shower. Their only motivation is one more dose. And people who fall into dopamine traps become almost the same drug addicts, I would say, socially acceptable drug addicts. And this is not an exaggeration. And the more these undeserved pleasures and drugs, the more dependence, the less motivation and the worse self-control is given to you.\n""\n""So, let\'s sum up the first part. Dopamine traps are specific activities and stimuli that completely throw off the normal rhythm of the dopamine system, dramatically increasing dopamine levels and then dramatically lowering them. Because of this, the base level of dopamine decreases and the receptors burn out. And because of this, a person ceases to enjoy less intense pleasures such as simple communication, achieving goals, and so on. Now let\'s quickly and in more detail go through the main and dopamine traps. And how to avoid them\? These dopamine thieves are making us weak-willed vegetables. And this is very important to understand. For if you want to have good self-discipline, and if you want to control your impulses and decide for yourself what to do and what not to do, some restrictions will have to be introduced."

    <string name="d3d3">"Thief trap number one. Let\'s talk about the Sahara. Ancient tribes in Peru chewed coca leaves for 1,000 years and did not experience any of the plant\'s narcotic properties. But if you remove the active ingredient cocaine from coca leaves and use it separately, the result may be different. The same can be said about the Sahara. I will even say more, without any exaggeration, sugar is more addictive than cocaine. And these are not my personal opinions, these are scientific data. That is why it is much easier for us to sing soda than, say, carrot juice. Therefore, we are more attracted to chocolates than apples. Until recently, scientists compared sugar consumption with drugs based on individual cases only. But now we have the opportunity to measure brain activity using scanners. It all started with a 2012 study that found a relationship between obesity and decreased sensitivity of dopamine receptors. And the more excess weight, the worse the new receptors reacted. Later in the same year, another study was conducted, as a result of which it turned out that obesity affects people in the same way as drug addiction. The function of the dopamine system is terribly reduced, as well as the deterioration of the function of memory and intelligence. Scientists summarize whether you are addicted to heroin or food. It hits the dopamine system equally hard. So how exactly does sugar affect us\? And is he really that bad\? When we put something sweet on our tongue, like a sugar cube, 1,000,000 years of evolution tells our brain that it\'s just a piece of fruit. The brain screams eat this and increases our appetite. This is because natural sweet foods are very beneficial. It\'s like you\'re downing a glass of soda and your brain thinks you just ate a handful of blueberries\n""\n""in which tons of antioxidants, phytonutrients and other substances. Naturally, he immediately tells you, consume, consume, consume until it\'s over. Under normal conditions, if we really ate blueberries, our intestines would at one point feel that okay, you ate enough of everything, and would tell the brain that saturation is over. However, this is not the case with refined sugar. That is, we still want to eat. The brain sends signals to consume, consume, consume, and the intestines do not feel full. Therefore, we can drink soda almost indefinitely. As you understand, the dopamine system is responsible for this. And it is the dopamine system that makes us consume sugar. Edible sugar causes a copious release of dopamine in the brain. Huge so big that it is comparable to the effect of cocaine, which causes us to consume sugar almost indefinitely. That is why people who are prone to addiction get used to sweet foods faster than others. For example, those who quit smoking find themselves craving sugar. Why\? The dopamine center works. The brain needs a stimulus, and sugar is the strongest stimulus. Thus, the consumption of modern food is in itself a hyperstimulation of the dopamine system. You are addicted to sugar and every day you want more and more sweet foods in more and more serious volumes. As a result, the base level of dopamine drops, as does motivation and overall enjoyment of life. You become prone to watching porn, to hanging out on social networks. You feel less motivated to act, and your subjective sense of time speeds up. What to do\? Stop eating what is sold in the form of convenience foods. Try, for example, to live for a week without a single spoonful of sugar, do not add it to tea, do not buy sugary drinks, do not eat processed foods, do not use sauces, and so on. I\'m sure it will break. You will want the taste, or rather, you will think that you want the taste. What you really need is the dopamine boost that sugar provides. It should be understood and fixed in the mind that sweets in modern products are far from the same as sweets, fruits. Refined sugar is not bound to fiber, which causes a very sharp increase in blood sugar levels and lowers insulin sensitivity. And even low insulin sensitivity itself results in fewer new receptors. That is, the more sugar and fat we eat, the less motivation we catch in life. Our brain is used to thinking that sweets are a great source of quality energy, and they are right. If you take fruits and sweet vegetables, so it is. This is an excellent source of calories. But modern sugar is nothing like what our bodies have been dealing with throughout evolution. Modern sugar is the purest drug. And scientists have proved this thesis many times in the most serious experiments. Naturally, food manufacturers have learned very well how sugar works and have begun to add it literally everywhere. Each manufacturer is interested in you buying their product. Therefore, at least he will pour heroin there, as long as you buy it. And, of course, it should be allowed. Manufacturers add sugar to canned food, whether it\'s sweet or savory sauces, convenience foods, baked goods, drinks, and just about everything. It is now almost impossible to find products sold in packages that do not contain added sugar. This is just unreal. And where it is written that there is no sugar, other, no less powerful chemical stimulants are added. Scientists have calculated that Americans, for example, eat about 22 tablespoons of sugar per day. You may think that there is something wrong with the Americans, but in reality it is only an appearance. One half-liter Cola contains about 10 tablespoons of sugar, and 100 grams of muesli contains six more spoons, and so on. In a word, sugar is added absolutely everywhere. And even if you seem to be on the right diet, you can\'t avoid sugar if you eat processed foods. Friends, this is not a fairy tale. This is much more serious than it seems. Food addiction is not a myth, it is a reality that is destroying our lives, futures and success. For example, at Princeton University, sugar addiction was studied in rats. Rats were given sugar, after which they quickly got used to it and began to increase the dose. Everything is as usual, all rats and people behave this way. Abstinence from sugar in these rats caused a relapse with the consumption of huge amounts of sugar. Nothing new here. But the most interesting thing began when scientists decided to give rats alcohol instead of sugar. It turned out that sugar-addicted rats knocked out much more alcohol than their neighbors. Thus, it was concluded that sugar actually changes the brain and promotes the development of other bad habits. It kind of makes you less intelligent. But the scientists didn\'t stop there and injected the rats with a very low dose of amphetamine. With such a dose of health, the body of rats would not have reacted in any way even without addictions. However, the sugar rats began to behave inappropriately. They were hyperactive, which clearly showed typical drug addiction. The scientist concludes that the changes that sugar does to the brain are very similar to the changes caused by cocaine, heroin, nicotine and morphine. There have been other studies in rats looking at sugar addiction. As a result of these studies, scientists caused real withdrawal in rats, complete trembling of teeth, asociality, unwillingness to act, a drop in living standards, and so on. In short, sugar, my friends, this is no joke. This is a very dangerous drug that literally destroys our will, self-discipline and desire to live. The only way it differs from, say, heroin is that it does not cause a “high” and does not damage our body. Therefore, a sugar addict looks like all normal people. But his willpower and ability to self-control is greatly reduced.\n""\n""However, there is an even more dangerous combination. It\'s delicious fat. Any animal by nature strives for food that contains a lot of calories. And fat, as you know, has more calories than carbohydrates. For example, I saw a video in which ordinary herbivorous deer are happy to eat fatty meat. Why does he do this\? Is meat suitable for him as a source of nutrition\? Of course no. He will get huge health problems, but there is nothing he can do about it. We naturally crave fatty foods. Therefore, we so want, for example, chips. There is sugar, flavor enhancers and a lot of fried fat. These are the three things that are most enjoyable for us. And despite the fact that everyone knows that chips are harmful, we still buy them. They are so attractive to us. This is where the two most powerful food pieces, fat and sugar, come together. For example, why do we like pastries and cakes so much\? It\'s fat with a lot of sugar. Why do we like halvah so much\? It\'s fat with a lot of sugar. In short, I can go on forever, but the essence is the same. Wherever sugar and fat can be found, the most powerful food addiction is hiding in one place, which, in fact, destroys your will to live. In the part about rebooting, I will tell you how to get rid of this addiction and bring your dopamine system back to normal. So we\'ll come back to this topic Sugar and fat."

    <string name="d3d4">"Thief trap number two is modern flavor enhancers. In April 2014, American scientists found a relationship between the consumption of sugary drinks and depression. Be it soda, iced tea or fruit juice. We\'ve just discussed sugar, but scientists this time, in addition to sugar, found another suspect - aspartame. A chemical that is able to modulate serotonin, dopamine and other neurotransmitters. On this score, scientists have very different opinions: from safe in any quantities to dangerous in any quantities. And this confrontation began back in the 80s, when aspartame was first used. Scientists then raised an eyebrow and warned consumers about the dangers of aspartame. And the danger is really a special risk group - people prone to depression. As a result of one study, scientists found SUCH side effects that it was decided to cancel the experiment, because it would simply be unethical to continue it. Scientists have identified about two dozen side effects of aspartame. Already another study from 2008 suggests that aspartame consumption not only changes brain chemistry, but also contributes to the development of mental and emotional disruptions, impairing learning and memory. Other scientists say with full confidence that it is not a toxic substance at all. The most recent 2014 study looked at people who consumed only half the allowable amount of aspartame per day, and after just two weeks of such a diet, their mood, brain function were disturbed, they did worse on some tests and were less oriented in space. And these were not people at high risk of depression. These were ordinary people. Scientists sum up consumption, and aspartame affects neuro-behavioral health, so it should be avoided. Easier said than done. After all, aspartame is found in over 6,000 food items. Modern studies even say that it is now almost impossible for us to completely avoid the consumption of aspartame. But for Americans, it\'s really almost impossible. They have a whole culture built around processed food. But we then quite recently still ate potatoes and cereals. We haven\'t forgotten how to cook food yet. We still have a chance to remain mentally healthy people. Aspartame, like sugar, like salt, like monosodium glutamate, is contained in almost all semi-finished products, in all packages in everything that has been prepared for you. This is in any dish, in a cafe, restaurant, in all sports bars, streets and other garbage. Boycott modern food. Go back to what our ancestors ate. The modern capitalist world is not interested in strong disciplined personalities. He needs a consumer who8 ocloc\'k plows like a horse a day, and gets all the pleasure of life from the chemistry they have prepared for you. Yes, aspartame is a very controversial topic. But the more I dig into the research, the less I trust the people who make it. Finding the truth in this matter is very difficult. One thing is for sure, behind aspartame there are very serious people who have global power and are capable ofmove global business of entire countries. I don’t want to joke with aspartame, especially considering that even before all this hype, this substance was considered extremely toxic. And in general, with all the innovations you need to be very careful. We live in a commercial world where the sole job of investors is to get you to buy their product. Our parents did not know such a mockery of consciousness. We are the first generation to face such barbaric and unprecedented destruction and humiliation of our nervous system, brain and fortitude. Watch what you eat\! Remember, it\'s one thing to chew coca leaves and quite another thing to chew cocaine. So, I have already said a lot about the need to remove refined sugar, aspartame, monosodium glutamate from the diet. But there is one more thing. I will talk about it in the next lesson."
</string>
    <string name="d3d5">"The thief is trap number three. Fat. The food industry, according to scientists, as well as the tobacco industry, have found some food elements that, like any other drug, are addictive through exposure to a new reward system. For example, diets rich in fat cause the destruction of the dopamine system. If you eat, for example, fatty yogurt, then within 30 minutes the same situation is visible on the brain tissues as when taking some kind of soda. Frequent consumption of fatty ice cream provokes the death of new receptors in the brain. This is when entire parts of the brain lose their effectiveness significantly. The same thing happens with drug addiction. So what do sugar and fat have in common\? They are very saturated with light energy. As a result, the consumption of such food fills the brain with dopamine and reduces its effectiveness. I have already talked about this in past lessons, and you may have a common question, why not eat fatty foods now\? Wrong. Fatty foods can be eaten. But there is a huge difference between, say, an avocado, in which the fat is tied to fiber, and ice cream, in which the fat is in free form. Fiber prevents the rapid absorption of nutrients: both fat and sugar. So when eating normal food, you will not feel the addictive effect. And if you spread butter on a sandwich, then just catch a new buzz. Do you understand the difference\? Fat can only be consumed if it comes with the product itself. The same difference between, say, leaves, coca, cocaine and crack. If you eat coca leaves, then there will be no effect. If you sniff cocaine, then you will be pinned. And if you smoke crack, it hits you 100 times stronger, because the active substance enters the brain much faster. Chemically, these substances are the same, but the result is always different, due to the difference in the delivery of the substance. So the food industry knows very well that if you separate sugar and fat from fiber, you can turn a consumer into a drug addict and use it very actively. Many scientists even believe that obesity is a mental illness. Well, what is very similar: you endlessly do some kind of action that harms you. At the same time, your brain resembles the brain of a drug addict, and your actions are absolutely inadequate. This is of course very handy for drug makers who like to lobotomize the chemicals in our brains. For example, some scientists give an opioid blocker from time to time, thereby eating less cheese during meals. Not surprisingly, people who have blocked opiate receptors do not want to use opiates. Yes, cheese is an opiate, it\'s not a fingerprint. Cheese is one of the most powerful narcotic drugs, which contains a huge amount of opium, with the help of which entire nations are planted on specific products. You didn’t think that you just like pizza so much because it’s simply better than borscht. Just don\'t get annoyed. I\'m not taking your cheese. You are now beginning to feel annoyed, not because I am depriving you of the right to eat some kind of food, but because this is a real addiction and your irritation is an indicator of a real addiction. However, the choice is yours anyway. I\'m just passing on information. Foods in which sugar and fat are not attached to fiber are addictive foods: cheese, cake, ice cream, sweets, buns, butter, and so on. This is something to be avoided. Our ancestors practically did not eat these products. Modern man has increased their consumption hundreds of times. Draw your own conclusions. I\'m just providing scientific information. A large amount of fat in the diet destroys the dopamine system.\n""\n""But not only large amounts of fat kill dopamine. There is such a thing as saturated fat. And if your diet contains a lot of saturated fat, then this harms the dopamine system.\n""Saturated fat is found in all animal foods and to a lesser extent in plant foods. So in order to preserve the dopamine system, I would advise limiting animal food.\n""\n""What about sugar, aspartame, monosodium glutamate, excess fat in the diet, saturated fat, as well as processed and prepared foods for you. All these things should be removed from your diet. If you want to keep the dopamine system normal. And on this, perhaps, the topic of dietary restrictions can be completed. I hope I didn\'t upset you too much.\n""\n""Wait though. There is a fourth trap, which is also partly related to food. It\'s called food porn. Anyone who has Instagram on their phone knows very well what food porn is. Dozens of food photos shot at the perfect angle, rich colors and eye-catching. What do you think it is\? It\'s the same dopamine trap. It turns out that hyper-realistic images of food elicit a huge response from the dopamine system. Scientists have even proven that a completely full and healthy person begins to feel hungry at the sight of beautiful photos of food. Food porn is a super normal irritant. Interestingly, our reaction to food porn is the stronger the higher the blood sugar. In short, the worse we eat, the stronger the reaction of our dopamine system to an attractive food picture. So, I will not talk about this topic for a long time, but will only draw your attention to the fact that food porn is a serious stimulant for your brain. Your desire to look at pictures of food is a wake-up call that you have some kind of problem with the dopamine system. The problems with food that we have just talked about are a serious obstacle to self-discipline. I would even say that this is the most powerful obstacle, except for pornography. So in the next lessons we will deal with getting rid of these habits. And now let\'s continue about other dopamine traps."
</string>
    <string name="d3d6">"Well, friends, we proceed to the most interesting topic for me. It\'s even more interesting than food. Although I am much more interested in nutrition. But I really like to talk about the fifth trap. Gadgets, internet and social networks. Yes, you probably already know that all these things are not a very useful thing, but you can hardly imagine the scale of this problem and the power with which it affects our lives and the ability to self-discipline. About 70% of Americans as of 2015 cannot fall asleep without their gadgets. In Finland, Internet-addicted guys are given a deferment from the army. Gadget - addiction - is a recognized disease at the interstate level. This is a real problem that most of the so-called modern advanced humanity suffers from. Now I will explain how it works. Our ancestors developed in an environment where any information could be very useful. Any additional information about the world around us, the dangers lurking in it, about resources, about the opinions of others, and so on, was very valuable. Every tiny piece of data could lead to a flourishing community. Therefore, our brain appreciates new information very much. Modern scientists have already found out that when we learn something new and interesting, it causes the production of dopamine. But before, in order to learn something new, you had to make trips, do reconnaissance, read books, do experiments, and so on. Now it’s enough just to go online, slap on the app on your phone and scroll down to infinity, filling in tons of pseudo-useful information.\n""\n""It causes the wildest release of dopamine and acts like any other drug. Your body seems to think that you are doing something extremely important. It\'s such a lot of important data, a whole bunch. Your tribe will be pleased. Whereas in reality you just sit and watch Instagram. Basically, it\'s just a drug. The same drug as sugar and nicotine. Scientists from the University of Chicago in their experiment compared the strength of the stimulus from social networks and found that their power is greater than from cigarettes or alcohol. That is, addiction to them is extremely strong and should be classified as drug addiction. You may not feel it, but gadgets and social networks cause a subtle feeling of euphoria. Watching the news feed is like a puff, a cigarette, or a sip of alcohol. From a biochemical point of view, social networks are even more dangerous because it happens without your knowledge and works on an unconscious level. But getting new information is not all that social networks provide. They also have another lever that knocks down the dopamine system no less powerfully. This is a reward system. I think you guessed what I mean. These are likes and reposts. You just post a picture of your food and you get rewarded and approved by a whole bunch of friends. Dopamine makes us seek approval. And social networks cope with this task by 100%.\n""\n""True, in parallel they kill your will to live. Another leverage is expressing your opinion. The Internet and social networks like YouTube give us this opportunity. I watched the video, left comments, got a surge of dopamine. When you express your opinion in the comments, your brain thinks that you are kind of being listened to. Maybe you\'re even speaking in front of the entire tribe now. So it turns out that you\'re kind of an important person, keep doing what you\'re doing. Is this how your brain thinks\? But that\'s not all. Reposts work both in one direction and in the other. When you repost, you share important information with others. Evolutionarily, this is rewarded with a surge of dopamine. We are kind of passing on very important data to our tribe that will potentially improve your survivability. I could go on and on, but please don\'t take this lightly. Because the corporate world around you wants you to be drug addicts. Drug addicts bring a lot of profit. Therefore, every self-respecting brand goes out of their way to get you hooked on their product. This is the logical and normal development of the capitalist world. Don\'t be surprised by this. This is reality. If you have self-discipline issues, you are an addict, accept that and take action accordingly. In the part about rebooting, I will tell you how to get rid of addiction to social networks. Now let\'s continue with the dopamine traps."

    <string name="d3d7">"The thief is trap number six. Computer and mobile games. The most popular mobile games are specifically, I repeat, specifically designed to make you addictive. This should not surprise you. This is fine. Mobile app makers make money from ads and microtransactions, so they will definitely use any means to get you to play this game, given that this system is not regulated by law. It would be foolish of them not to do this, given that there is a lot of data on this subject. Even certain colors evoke a certain mental response in us, such as hunger or the desire to do something. What can we say about games. Computer games are another scourge of our time. I can speak about him with particular confidence, because at one time I myself suffered from this problem. And anyone who says that games are not a drug is either an addict himself or does not understand what he is talking about. This is one of the most powerful things for releasing dopamine. Remember: addiction is when you do something just for fun. Leveling up, leveling up a character, completing a quest, killing a monster or terrorist, winning a strategic fight or winning a round is a powerful new lever. Again, computer games use our ancient levers. You kind of do something that is very very important, destroying the enemy. This means there is less competition. So better survival. Raised the level. Handsome, so you can continue the family and so on. Thus, in itself, the mechanics of any computer game are pseudo successes that occur inadequately, quickly causing hyperstimulation and killing the desire to live. Any computer and mobile games should be removed from your life. Lack of discipline and computer games are links in the same chain. And now it\'s time to talk about the most important topic of the Thief - trap number seven. Pornography. I don\'t think I need to explain why it knocks down the dopamine system. However, let\'s take a closer look at this topic. Now many people say that there is nothing wrong with porn. But in reality, scientific research on this topic paints a completely different picture. If it surprises you that today\'s youth are passive compared to their parents, know that the average teenager watches about 50 porn videos a week. This means that every day he sees about seven naked women who are realistically attractive. As a result, the wildest unprecedented production of dopamine and complete life passivity as a result. Don\'t think it was the same before. Previously, pornography was paid, it had age restrictions. Porn used to be less accessible. It took a lot of effort to find him. And as a result, there would be one video with a single woman, and even in poor quality. In the past, society has repressed porn viewing, which has held many back. Before there was no variety. There were no extreme genres, you could watch one scene at a time. Now porn is free and available at any second of time, it has no age restrictions. It is available from every modern gadget. Now you can watch a dozen different videos in a variety of settings for every taste and color in a five-minute period of time. There are a bunch of genres, access to which is always open. In short, before and now these are two fundamental differences.\n""\n""Thanks to the Internet, the most powerful dopamine activator has broken through. Literally everyone can create an absolute high for themselves at any second. We are becoming more and more like rats with an electrode in their brains. I\'ll tell you a little more about the Coolidge effect. What happens if you take a male rat and give him females for fertilization\? Say, they gave him one female, he fertilized her and calmed down, he would go, eat and do other things. But if, after fertilization, he is given another female, his body will perceive this as an ideal opportunity for procreation. He will pounce on the second and inseminate her too, and then on the third, and the fourth, and the fifth. And will do it to the point of exhaustion with attractive men and women on the Internet, depending on your gender.\n""Pornography causes burnout of dopamine receptors, and it takes time for them to recover. That is, watching porn, a person guarantees himself without liberty for some time. Probably the only thing worth saying here is that pornography is the number one discipline destroyer. While you\'re watching porn, don\'t even dream of having discipline. Yes, you may think that your life is pretty organized, but believe me, you just do not know your resources. You have no idea how powerful you can be as a person. You can be 1000 times more organized productive and powerful in a part, namely reloading. I will tell you how to get rid of this habit. Until then, let\'s continue."

    <string name="d3d8">"The thief is trap number eight. Too much novelty. dopamine is responsible for the feeling of novelty. New sensations, new knowledge, new partners and new impressions. This is what dopamine responds to. The natural world in this sense maintains a balance. But over the last 30-40 years we have created for ourselves an unnatural world of constant novelty. Sexual novelty, pornography is only part of it. There is also the mentioned informational novelty of social networks. There is also a food novelty, which I mentioned earlier. Here is the novelty of experiments, which includes a number of things. For example, listening to new music every day or, for example, watching new movies and having an extreme experience. Understand correctly, novelty is good, but it becomes wrong and inappropriate, and even harmful when it is absolutely useless. Everything I just listed is pleasure for the sake of pleasure, it does not have any side effects, like eating berries, for example. When you consume a berry, you get a lot of antioxidants in addition to pleasure. When you eat sugar, you get only pleasure. It\'s the same with movies or listening to new music. It does not provide any new mental benefits of deep experiences, but only skims over the surface of pleasure over emotions. No matter what you think, no matter how you justify watching movies in 3D and listening to new music endlessly, this has never happened in our history and it is very naive to think that this plays into your hands. For example, the former CEO of Facebook openly stated that he does not allow his children to use social networks, because it is a means of enslavement. The elite don\'t listen to pop, they go to the opera once a week. That\'s all their music. And we have been taught to consider as the norm what is not the norm. We stop truly appreciating unique experiences.\n""\n""We are becoming more and more addicts. In a word, almost everything that is invented in the modern world, for the sake of corporate profits, is tied to a price and, regardless of what you think about it, will kill your self-discipline, self-control, and in general will make you a controlled animal. I hope I don\'t upset you too much with my lectures and instructions, because, most likely, I have listed all the things that you like, and it is not surprising that you like it, because these are really things that cause addiction. And the specifics of the modern world are designed in such a way to cause addiction in you. That\'s why you want it so badly. And therefore, you will probably feel dissatisfied when you again listen to some of my censures of the achievements of the modern world. I would really like to say that in fact everything is simpler, that the specifics of the modern world do not affect our self-discipline, our level of self-control, our awareness. But it is not. That would just be a lie. I\'m not interested in telling sweet lies. I speak the truth. And this is not my personal opinion. This is the opinion of many experts and scientists. And, unfortunately, this is the reality in which we live, we have to work with it. Previously, the enemy was clearly addressed, he rushed at you with a sword in his hands. Now the enemy is everywhere and to distinguish where is a friend and where is an enemy: this is your task. If you do not know how to distinguish the enemy, then he will cut off your head. And this is the reality of the modern world. Our enemies are big corporations that have no place for the individual. There is only room for capital and profit. Capital has no soul, it has no compassion.\n""\n""We can hardly imagine that we can face such an inhuman approach to our essence. But this approach does exist. And if you just try to apply in life what I\'m talking about here, that is, get rid of all the above habits. You will notice such a huge difference that you will simply have no doubt that I am telling the truth.\n""\n""The thief is trap number nine. Blue light. The blue light of the screens of our computers, tablets and smartphones is another pest of the dopamine system. It increases the secretion of dopamine and can even serve as a regulator of dopamine receptors, as well as cause serious disorders of neurotransmitters and other hormones. Although blue light increases the secretion of dopamine, it negatively affects the dopamine system in the long run. How to avoid it\? Install the “flux” program on your computer and touch your phone less, or you can also install the “Twilight” program. Also, while working at the computer, you can wear special glasses that block the blue light of the screens. You can buy them at any online store.\n""\n""Go ahead. The thief is trap number ten. Chronic diseases and inflammation. Persistent chronic pain and prolonged stress. This is another reason for low dopamine. The only way to combat this is a healthy lifestyle and especially a high intake of antioxidants, that is, berries and vegetables and fruits.\n""\n""Thief - trap number eleven is alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. Alcohol, nicotine and other drugs, with rare exceptions, work on the dopamine system. It is due to the dopamine system that addiction occurs. Of course, these are very powerful stimulants, one of the strongest. Given their availability, they, along with sugar and other food-based drugs, are among the worst enemies of the dopamine system. The joint consumption of these substances brings a doubly dangerous condition. In short, if you suffer from these habits, there is nothing to think about the health of the dopamine system. You\'ve never seen a motivated drug addict. They just don\'t exist and never will. It doesn\'t matter if you drink once a week or once a month. It is equally powerful in knocking down your dopamine receptors.\n""\n""So, we\'ve looked at a whole host of thieves of our dopamine. Avoid these guys and you\'ll be fine. If we allow them into our lives, then the dopamine system collapses. As a result, we turn into undisciplined, fussy, underachieving, helpless little creatures that are very easy to manipulate. But let\'s not hang all the blame on the commercial environment. There are things that we do on our own and kill our dopamine system. For example, multitasking kills dopamine, lack of a schedule also negatively affects us. Haste, fussiness, constant employment without proper rest. All these things negatively affect the base level of dopamine. Remember, we need to keep dopamine at a stable mid-high level throughout the day. Dopamine spikes should not be allowed. You can not allow sharp drops in dopamine. We need stable, normal natural levels of dopamine and high sensitivity of receptors. Therefore, it is necessary to exclude all dopamine traps - stimulants. This will be our first step towards self-discipline. Once you learn how to manage your condition, you will know what easy self-discipline is.\n""Well, I\'m done with all the dopamine traps. In the next lessons I will tell you what to do with all this and how to live now. After all, avoiding all these things in the modern world is almost unrealistic. So how do you maintain discipline\? Do not worry. There is a way out, and it is adequate."
</string>


    <string name="d4d1">"So dopamine reset. To begin with, I will clarify once again what it gives. After all, many probably have not yet fully realized how important it is. In fact, this is the only first step that is worth taking on the path to absolute self-discipline. Yes, for some it may seem too unusual or too complicated. But if you want to get a fundamentally new result, you will have to do fundamentally new actions in the world of motivation. I noticed only two approaches. The first is the path of fear. They intimidate you in every possible way, and under the influence of this intimidation you break down to do something. The second approach is the fat chunk approach. They show you what you supposedly want. And you start to run headlong there. Both of these approaches are flawed. After all, they are based on the so-called “pinning”. It’s as if you are being “pushed” to a certain result. Well, or from some kind of result. Either fear or fat. But, as I said, no normal person can work in this mode for a long time. At one point, fear will no longer be so terrible in comparison with constant kicks. And the piece will not seem worthy of such suffering. The only thing that works is when you, without much effort and without external motivation of “kicking”, independently give rise to a desire to do something. Well, for example, no one ever scares you: You will die of hunger, go to the kitchen, eat. If you do not buy, then you will leave this world. It\'s stupid, isn\'t it\? You will eat when you feel hungry. In the same way, no one will scream in your ear: Hey buddy, this slice of pizza is so chic, so cool, so delicious, take a bite of it, TAKE IT. Absurd. This never happens. If you have a piece of pizza in front of you, you will eat it anyway, no external motivation is needed. This is exactly how it should be with any other deeds and useful actions. There should be no extrinsic motivation like a $1,000,000 Mercedes or fear of total poverty. These things only work temporarily and are very inefficient. Instead, your body should be rewarded in the act itself. Like when you eat pizza, you don\'t eat it to stay alive, but because you just enjoy eating it. Thus, the dopamine reset is needed in order to enjoy actions again, in order to become a child again, who can perform simple actions and at the same time enjoy as if he won the lottery. The key to the dopamine reset lies in our salt example. When the average person tries to develop self-discipline, it\'s pathetic to watch. Why\? One gets the feeling that, having got used to very salty and delicious food spilled with sauces, he suddenly switched to simple buckwheat cooked without salt. And here he is sitting at the table and choking on this buckwheat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. After a week of such wonderful food, he buys sweets, sauces, chips, throws out buckwheat and starts eating even more garbage than before. When will he next try to start eating plain buckwheat again\? Not soon. Even if everyone around will talk about how harmful chips are and how useful buckwheat is, he realized for himself that buckwheat is not for him.\n""\n""That\'s about the same thing happens with people who take on self-discipline. For half their lives, they get into the smartphone, watch porn, eat excessively sweet and salty trash, lead a hectic social lifestyle. Watching YouTube all day, going to the movies and watching movies on the weekends, and then all of a sudden decides it\'s time to start doing something. And so, usually from Monday they wake up at 5 o\'clock, go for a run, then have breakfast with something useful, work and play sports all day, and in the evening read Kant\'s criticism of pure reason. This way of life simply does not bring them pleasure. They are accustomed to much more powerful stimulation of the dopamine system. Not books, but posts in contact, not training courses, but comedies in the cinema. Not deep communication with a mentor, but hangouts, with friends and so on. Such a transition from burgers to simple buckwheat has never brought pleasure to anyone. But like I said, enjoyment is the only thing that matters. Only the pleasure you get in the moment of action will allow you to succeed in self-discipline. Therefore, until you learn to enjoy simple routine actions and self-discipline, you will not wait for a positive result.\n""\n""Here is the key. That\'s what the dopamine reboot is for. When you announce dopamine receptors and make them more sensitive. So, what should a person do who wants to feel the taste of ordinary, unsalted buckwheat again, but who is used to salting and peppering his food mercilessly\? Reboot. Rebooting taste buds occurs within a few months, dopamine receptors need to be rebooted for the same amount.\n""\n""So, the dopamine reset is temporary - a complete rejection of all hyper-stimulants of the dopamine system. During the new reboot, we force our receptors to clear excess dopamine, as a result of which the production of dopamine itself is significantly reduced. The receptors become more sensitive and increase in number. As a result, you will begin to be motivated by things that previously caused melancholy. And what pleased you before will seem like too much stimulation. This is when you try something too salty or too sweet. Sickening feeling. Rebooting is something that in today\'s world needs to be done every year and a half. Maybe a year. This is fasting in the world of pleasure. In general, fasting is one of those tools that should be present in every aspect of our lives. From time to time you need to spend another day without food. Sometimes you need to limit yourself in communication. And, of course, sometimes it is necessary to remove all the pleasures. This is the only way to keep yourself in a stable sensitive state and enjoy simple actions, simple food and simple life. And this, in turn, leads to iron self-discipline."
</string>
    <string name="d4d2">"So where does the dopamine reset start\? First, you need to identify bad habits. In general terms, we have already determined this. There are, of course, many more than I managed to indicate in previous lessons. But these are global trends. These are the things that work for everyone, because they are designed specifically for this. This is excessive tasty food, excessive pleasures, excessive novelty and hyperstimulation of consciousness. So all these wonderful networks, as well as social networks, excessive music, pornography and other joys of our time, we have to give up. But let\'s go in order.\n""\n""Zero step. The world around during the new reboot.\n""\n""Let\'s start with this. Probably, many will not like it, and some will even outrage. But, as I have repeated and will repeat, any extraordinary results require extraordinary actions. So, the environment for a successful, fast and high-quality reboot should be devoid of any stimulants. Do you know why many hermits and monks are happy and absolutely disciplined\? They live in a world devoid of overstimulation. They do not see attractive members of the opposite sex. The bright lights of the big city do not sparkle in their eyes. They don\'t see the posters around and the music doesn\'t play around. There is no excess approval and communication in social networks. In a word, these are people who have a very high sensitivity of dopamine receptors, and their number is greater than that of the majority of the world\'s population. So, they get high from the simplest actions, including the observance of discipline. A simple act of awareness is regarded by their body as something that should be rewarded. I do not call you to become a hermit and avoid the opposite sex, but you can arrange for yourself reasonable, acceptable monastic conditions that will bring you into a state of normality. And the state of the norm will already put you on a step above most people.\n""\n""The ideal option for a dopamine reboot is complete solitude somewhere in nature, away from civilization and closer to birds, trees and pure nature. Such a place should be as boring as possible by modern standards. In such a place there is no access to news, movies, social networks, excess food. In a word, such a place is a condition for the life of our ancestors. Given all the material I have presented, it is unlikely that you have a question “why\?” But I\'ll explain anyway. In such an environment, where external stimulants are completely absent, your dopamine system is maximally rebooted. Receptors are restored, their sensitivity increases and the level of secretion returns to normal. This practice has been used by mankind since time immemorial. Our ancestors lived in such an environment. And to enhance the effect, the conditions were made even more stringent. But we are far from this, and the modern world does not require such measures. So we can limit ourselves to less powerful things. How it works in the modern world is clearly seen in the example of one conqueror of the Arctic. Once he was asked how do you determine the time of the need for the return of the polar expedition\? To which the conqueror of the Arctic quite simply replied: There is only one woman on my expedition. When recruiting people for an expedition, I choose the ugliest woman I meet. And if already during the expedition this woman seems to me a beauty, then it means that the time has come to return to the mainland.\n""\n""That is, when the system is isolated from the means stimulating it, the sensitivity of this system increases. For example, if you don\'t eat for a week, your sensitivity to tastes increases. If you have not seen a woman for a year, then even an old woman will become attractive. And finally, if you stop bombarding your mind with an endless stream of dopamine stimulants, then the sensitivity of the dopamine system increases. A simple but effective rule. Of course, I understand that not everyone can go to nature and turn himself into a monk for a month. So I developed a more convenient plan. You can take advantage of it even if you work every day and have to live a normal life. However, if you have the opportunity to just go somewhere, live on potatoes and carrots for a couple of weeks, walk through the forests, listen to birdsong and swim in the river. Do it. This is much MUCH easier than reloading dopamine in the city and the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Especially since the sun is there. And the sun is very important. Research shows that exposure to the sun improves the sensitivity of dopamine receptors.\n""\n""So let\'s go. If you live in a city, then before proceeding with the reboot, you need to set up the environment. It is advisable to start all this in your free time, for example, on vacation or during a vacation, or on some long weekend. But if this is not possible, then you can start on a regular day off. Make sure your apartment is clean and more minimally necessary. Throw out the trash, vacuum the carpets and wipe the dust. It is advisable to rearrange the furniture. Our behavior is very dependent on the environment. If you turned on your computer and sat down at social networks for three years, coming home after work, your brain got used to it. You open the door of your apartment, see the familiar environment and do everything according to the knurled. Including turn on the computer and sit down for social networks. So if you decide to reboot your brain and get rid of social networks, you will have to fight a two-year-old habit. You kind of go home, everything is the same as it was before. You see the same place, and then in the middle of this habitual process you try to pull out the usual link. However, if you change the environment itself, if you change the whole chain of events and surrounding impulses in which this sequence of actions was triggered, it will be easier for you to control yourself. Agree, sitting in a restaurant, you do not want to turn on the computer and start chatting with friends. And in the toilet you do not wake up appetite. Our environment creates our desires in the truest sense of the word. If you enter the kitchen and instinctively open the refrigerator, your eyes fall on the shelf where sweets usually lie. It\'s time to change the situation in the kitchen. You enter the apartment, and here everything is unfamiliar. Clothes should be hung somewhere else. And to turn on the computer, you need to do completely different steps. To eat a piece of cake, you need to strain your brain once again. You see, when there is a new environment around you, old neural connections stop working and eventually die off, and new ones that you form on your own take their place. If you change your apartment inside, then a window will open for you to rewrite your brain. We\'ll talk more about this in future lessons. In the meantime, just understand, you need to change the environment as much as possible. If there is no way to rearrange the furniture, then at least make basic changes. For example, put up a big poster with a slogan that will draw attention to itself at least in the first couples when you enter the room or change the curtains, or light incense sticks to change the perception of the room. In a word, everything that you can think of to change the situation at the level of emotions, visual perception of smell and, in general, any sensations. This must be done not only at home, but in general, wherever you are present. For example, a good idea would be to change the way home. Take a slightly different path, get off at a stop earlier or later. Buy products in another store, sit on other benches. In short, I repeat, any change in the environment will be useful during the dopamine reset. This is necessary so that the old neural connections weaken their influence.\n""\n""Go ahead. In addition to changing the environment, you should pay attention to the brightness of this environment. If you enter the living room and you have a plasma hanging on the floor of the wall, do not be surprised that you are drawn to turn on the TV and sit with it until the end of the evening. This is an objective trigger for negative actions. It doesn\'t matter if you made the change or not. Therefore, if you have such an opportunity, get these things out of sight\! You do not need a TV, and this is objective.\n""\n""A disciplined person does not fight with himself. He simply does not allow himself to want what is harmful to him. For example, if my work was not related to the computer, I would simply remove it from my room and leave only a desk, books and work supplies. Which, in fact, I advise everyone to do if you are just having fun at the computer. Remove it when not needed. Why do you need him now\? It obviously only harms your productivity. If you want to relax, you can always do something else. After all, our ancestors lived somehow and did not watch movies every day and did not play games. However, their stress levels were lower. You can do the same with sweets, if they are not in the refrigerator, then you will not be able to eat them either. In the store, choose a route of movement so as not to pass by the shelves with harmful products. In short, come up with the logistics of your movements. Understand how the environment affects you\!\n""\n""So let\'s sum it up. Your world around you must either completely change to some kind of suburban place where there are few people and no frills of the modern world. Or you have to change your world on your own through cleaning, rearrangement, replacement of routes and through the maximum simplification of the world around you. I advise you to immediately treat this as a fight against drug addiction. Although you do not consider yourself a real drug addict, you need to treat the process exactly as a healing process. After all, you will feel bad, someone may even become depressed. It\'s called breaking. In our society, it is not customary to call it breaking, but the essence of the phenomenon is just that. You will miss the fun. And just believe me, the less in the world around you there will be a reminder of old bad habits, the better. It\'s like with smoking, if a person smokes next to you, then you want to smoke 100 times stronger.\n""\n""We go further. You need to remove all external sources of dopamine: lotteries, smoking, drugs, shopping, sugar and limit yourself to the maximum from social networks. All false pleasures must be removed. Those things that civilization invented and that we as a species are not used to. There are 40% more depression among smokers, but after quitting smoking after a few months, the likelihood of depression drops sharply. When you quit smoking, dopamine levels drop sharply, and the sensitivity of the receptors has not yet recovered. Because of this, the likelihood of relapse at first is very high. Banal presses the lack of dopamine. The same thing will happen to you. Scientists have confirmed this in mice. With nicotine withdrawal, dopamine levels plummet and drive rodents into depression. All the things that we will refuse are really no worse than nicotine. So it won\'t be fun. But the result is as if the addict becomes a normal person again. That\'s the difference between you before and after. So you will feel better. It is a fact. Now let\'s move on to more detailed instructions."
</string>
    <string name="d4d3">"Step one. We remove social networks and computer games. Anyone who thinks about self-discipline and wants to have control over their impulses, first of all, should cut social networks and eliminate computer games. If computer games need to be completely removed and never thought about them again, then it is almost impossible to imagine the modern world without social networks. Therefore, we will leave social networks, but exactly in the amount in which our life requires it. For example, those people whose work is related to social networks such as SMM specialists or marketers need to spend 2 or more hours a day. The average person, on the other hand, can well limit himself to social networks to 15-20 minutes a day and without any loss for his effectiveness. And these 15 minutes include VKontakte, Instagram, Twitter, other news feeds and everything else.\n""\n""Next, we\'ll talk about how to achieve this. First, let\'s assess our addiction to gadgets and social networks. According to scientific research, addiction is when we experience at least three of the following seven symptoms.\n""\n""First, over time, you need more to get the same effect. For example, if you used to have five minutes on social networks, now this number may already be 50 minutes or 5 hours. For example, my analogy is this. As a child, I got wild pleasure from computer games, and an hour was enough for me to be satisfied. But in the midst of my gambling addiction, I could play all day long and that was just enough to make me feel normal. And when there was no such opportunity, I felt discomfort. I wanted to get rid of everything as soon as possible in order to play games.\n""\n""Second, you experience negative feelings when you stop the habit. For example, the discomfort you feel when you have not logged into social networks and checked the likes. A feeling that something is not right. Some even feel that they have lost something important or missed something useful. How often do you experience discomfort when you leave home without a smartphone\? Is there a feeling of insecurity\? A kind of mental itch\?\n""\n""Third abuse. More consumption than originally intended. This applies not only to social networks, but also, say, sweets. You promise yourself to eat a spoonful, but in the end you will eat a whole mountain. Or you promise yourself to only check your messages, and after 2 hours you find yourself watching Instagram for the hundredth time.\n""\n""Fourth, special efforts to receive. This is when you go beyond the reasonable for the sake of the drug. For example, when you go on vacation, you choose a hotel not by the view from the window, but by the presence of Wi-Fi. Or when you refuse to meet with family and friends whom you have not seen for a long time, for the sake of another match in a computer game.\n""\n""Fifth ignoring the negative consequences. Well, for example, you keep doing something, despite the fact that it obviously has a negative effect. Say, from time to time you go to social networks or play computer games, despite the fact that you have not submitted a report or completed a project, deadline. After this, you usually experience despair and remorse, and promise yourself to behave correctly another time, but usually nothing happens.\n""\n""So, how often do you experience similar symptoms regarding gadgets, a smartphone, a computer, social networks, computer games, and indeed any of the things that we talked about above. Now that you are 99% sure that you have some signs of addiction, let\'s talk about how to get rid of them.\n""\n""First, read the book The Digital Diet by Daniel Berg.\n""\n""Second, acknowledge the addiction. As long as you deny the obvious, nothing will come of it. And the reality is that 90% of modern people suffer from either gambling or any other digital addiction. Clearly admit to yourself what consequences this or that occupation has for your life\? In this case, social networks, gadgets and games\? How much time per day do you spend on it\? Can you spend this time more effectively\? And if you can, why do you do it that way\? Isn\'t this an indicator of addiction\?\n""\n""Third. Remove gadgets from your life as much as possible. You don\'t quit smoking among smokers, do you\? You\'re not trying to abstain from sweets in a candy store. So you don’t have to fight gadgets, spreading a smartphone, laptop, tablet and computer around you, organize your space in such a way that there are as few harmful stimuli as possible in it. Do not use gadgets by inertia before picking up the phone again. Ask yourself why are you doing this\? Is it really so important for you to find out what happened there during this time while you were sleeping or eating\? Or are you doing it out of inertia out of habit\? For example, I put my phone away from my desk and only take it out when it\'s really necessary. When I receive SMS messages or when someone calls me, and after I have answered the message, I put it away again so that it does not distract me. If you\'re having lunch, talking with friends, or working, don\'t put your phone on the table, leave it in your bag or pocket. You will have fewer reasons to constantly turn it in your hands. The same can be said about the computer. We play games at the computer, and if our work is not directly related to it, remove it from our eyes, away, make it physically inaccessible.\n""\n""Fourth clear timetable. If your brain does not know exactly when and what to do, it begins to engage in amateur activities. If you clearly set the boundaries of what is acceptable, his zeal will be much less. That is, if your brain at the moment specifically knows what it should be doing, it will not have the thought to grab the phone and check the news feed. If he does not have such an understanding, he will start looking for alternative options and choose the simplest one. Namely, social networks, especially since they bring pleasure. So set limits for yourself. First, one day a week you spend absolutely. Without social networks, gadgets, computers and all that. Second, set specific hours for when you log into social media. For example, I have this time from 18:00 to 18:15. The rest of the time I completely limit myself from social networks and other irritants. Thirdly, walk in nature or in the park without a phone, leave it at home. Nothing will happen if you disappear from the information space for a couple of hours, if you cannot be contacted. You will probably catch a wild feeling of discomfort from the fact that you are walking without a phone, and no one can call you. But remember that even 50 years ago, no one had such an opportunity. There were landlines that stood in the apartments, and this was the only way to get in touch. And before that, there were only telegraph and letters. Therefore, nothing bad will happen. If you suddenly disappear from the information space.\n""\n""Fifth, understand that the benefits of the modern world should serve you, not limit you in your productivity and a couple of hours a day is enough to cover all your needs. So, in order for these very benefits in the form of social networks and gadgets to really serve you, do the following. Turn off your phone in the evening and turn it on in the morning at 11:00. Designate zones in your home where gadgets are prohibited. For example, I have this kitchen, although I generally saved my life from a smartphone, and I simply don’t have one. I gave it to my mother, and bought myself a regular dialer. So you can do it.\n""\n""But let\'s move on. To reduce your time on the Internet, put your lists in order. Start with email. Get rid of all the junk you don\'t read. Then go to social networks and remove all useless subscriptions that do not help you live in any way. Set up a social media news filter. Leave only the people closest to you, fortunately, both VKontakte and Facebook provide such an opportunity. For example, I have about five news a day in my feed.\n""\n""Go ahead. Clean apps on your smartphone or tablet, remove all junk. 90% of what is there, you just don\'t need it. Almost everything there serves one purpose: to distract you. Remove the junk and leave a couple of really important things that will not take up much of your time and make your life easier, not more cumbersome.\n""\n""So, friends, in the past lessons I focused your attention on how fasting interferes with our hormonal processes. Stop it. Do you really think that it is necessary to take pictures of your food and post it to the public or write your thoughts about the political situation in the country\? Do you really want to spend your life doing this, given how it affects your dopamine system\? Create privacy, do not tell or show your life to others. Nobody cares. And it harms you.\n""\n""If you give up social networks and gadgets, it will be hard for you. Ooh, I promise you. So reward yourself with real communication by finding yourself a couple of worthy people. However, we will talk about the environment later. But here it is very important to understand that until now you have devoted a huge amount of time to socialization on the Internet. It needs to be replaced with something, for example, real socialization. Find like-minded people, go to visit, tell stories. This causes a completely different reaction of the body, testosterone, oxytocin and so on are produced. Whereas social networks maximum put you on a fake relationship through the most real drug addict algorithms. We are more alone than ever, but more than ever, we communicate a lot, this should be talking about something.\n""\n""Well, we\'ve covered the main points. The more you limit yourself in social networks and computer games, the better the dopamine system will work and the better your life will become.\n""\n""Step number two. Remove porn. Now the most important thing is no porn at all. If you watch porn even once a week, it kills the human spirit, both in men and women. In this lesson, I will not describe how to refuse it. The instructions that I gave above regarding social networks are quite enough. That\'s just porn addiction is a more powerful stimulant. This means that it will be more difficult to refuse it. The physical inaccessibility of such entertainment is the surest approach. If there is no computer or gadget nearby on which you can turn on the video, then there is no desire. Desire arises in a certain environment. Remember this\! Change the environment so you don\'t create incentives. After all, sitting in a restaurant, you do not have a desire to watch porn and on the street, sitting on a bench, does not appear either. This creates an environment: you see your computer, on which you usually do this, and you have a desire. Or your smartphone. Therefore, we need to make these things physically inaccessible. For this lesson, I will give some links in English. These are complete resources with a huge amount of scientific data on this topic and with a full-fledged community of people who are struggling with this problem and detailed instructions. How can you implement this in your life. And we move on."

    <string name="d4d4">"Step Three: Gradually make food less stimulating. You have to become a real monk compared to how you eat now. We\'ll have to remove all sauces, mayonnaise, ketchups and other rubbish. The amount of salt and it is desirable to minimize, because it is also a very powerful stimulant. If you salt your food while cooking, then you don\'t need to deliver it at mealtime. Five grams of salt a day is more than enough. Sweets - forget it. We remove sweets, chocolate, table sugar. Yes, we also start drinking tea without sugar. If you don\'t like it, don\'t drink tea at all anyway. After all, buns and other garbage are also sent out of your diet. Also watch your fat intake. Excess saturated fat leads to burnout of dopamine receptors. Special attention should be paid to snacks. Oh, how you will want to throw something between the main meals. But it is also desirable not to do this. During the dopamine reboot, and indeed in normal life, there should be no snacks, no sandwiches, snickers, bars and other nonsense. Leave it in the past. Do you know why you really want to skew\? Not to satisfy hunger. And not in order to saturate yourself with microelements. You want to snack in a way that you lack the pleasure of life\! Lack of dopamine release. In other words, a snack is when there is no motivation and happiness. But food for you should first of all become a tool for obtaining the necessary trace elements and stop playing the role of the main pleasure. As with many drugs, the consumption of sugar and saturated fat leads to a spike in dopamine. In the long term, regular consumption of sugar and excess fat actually significantly alters gene expression and reduces the availability of dopamine receptors in the midbrain and frontal lobe. In particular, sugar, for example, increases the concentration of D1 type nerve receptors and decreases the concentration of another type of D2 receptor, which is an inhibitor. Regular consumption of sugar and excess fat also inhibits dopamine transporter action. This protein pumps out of the synapse and back into the neuron following an action potential. In short, this means that frequent consumption of sugar and fat leads to difficulty in signaling dopamine. Desensitizes brain pathways and increases the amount of product needed to activate middle brain dopamine receptors. The brain becomes tolerant to sugar and fat. A person has to consume them in increasing quantities to get the same high, limiting sugar and saturated fats, you will feel a significant reduction in cravings for junk food and stabilization of your mood. For an experiment, you can make yourself 40 days without sugar and fatty foods. This will be enough to overcome the addiction. At first it will be difficult, even very. But soon the withdrawal will pass and the process of restoring the dopamine system will begin. I can’t exactly answer the question of how long it will take you to get rid of sugar addiction. All people are too different. In addition, no large-scale human studies have been conducted on this topic. But after 40 days, you will usually be able to get past the worst and even be able to reverse some of the changes in dopamine signaling. Your usual sweets will seem too sweet for you. And this will be a sure sign that your sensitivity has recovered. Now let me break you down with a powerful list of foods loaded with sugar. I will not name the very obvious things like sweets and ice cream, but I will go through the most unusual ones.\n""\n""Yoghurts and all prepared dairy products such as chocolate milk and other any sauces, whether barbecue, sauces, hot sauces or sweet sauces, ketchup, mayonnaise, fruit juices in packages, any type of soda, including sports drinks and refrigeration, tea, sports bars and in general, any bars, even those on which the word sport is pathetically written. In general, it probably won’t be an exaggeration if I say that almost all products prepared for us contain sugar. If there is no sugar, then there is monosodium glutamate and its variations, which act even more powerfully than sugar. You don\'t have to completely change your entire diet in one day. Everything is individual here. For example, at one time I very abruptly refused any stimulating food and switched to a very modest diet. It was only difficult, probably, the first two or three weeks. Then the body adapted and began to get great pleasure from simple food. But I admit that this approach may not work for everyone. More precisely, not everyone can resist.\n""\n""Therefore, there is another option to reduce the whole thing gradually, say, stretch the changes in nutrition for a month or two, gradually reduce the amount of salt, sugar, sauces and everything that we talked about above. Let\'s say, set yourself a norm of seven buns a week, after a week you remove one bun, after another week, another bun. As a result, after seven weeks, more or less smoothly, you will refuse buns. In parallel, of course, you need to refuse other products. Or try the system every other day. Today you have a completely modest diet, and tomorrow you are more familiar. And then again. However, a long transition also has its drawbacks. Mainly you spend more time. And also the irritant is constantly present in your life. Therefore, I personally prefer the radical approach to go somewhere where there is no sugar, no computer, no people who eat eclairs in front of your eyes. But if you still reboot in the city and there are a whole bunch of irritants around you, then here are a couple more tips. Food in our refrigerator does not materialize out of thin air. We bring them from the store. So the question of limiting ourselves from these products is a question of what we spend our money on. To be more store conscious - change store. An unfamiliar environment will force you to be more conscious and make better choices. And best of all, ask a loved one to buy you the right products."

    <string name="d4d5">"Step four. Entertainment and small pleasures. In this training, we learn to do small things and enjoy them. Discipline is nothing but the ability to do what needs to be done. Drive in a nail if necessary, water the flowers, do your homework, meditate and, most importantly, get a kick out of it. Therefore, we should pay attention to these very simple things, pay more attention to them. Rhythmic, steady, and calm actions help stabilize dopamine and other neurotransmitter fluctuations. Modesty, restraint, monotony and peace should become your constant companions. You will not become a boring person. On the contrary, you will have more interests, more motivation, and you will be more sensitive. You will begin to experience intense pleasures from meditation, solitude, and reading long texts. You will become a more diverse person. Such a way of life will in no way limit you, but on the contrary, it will make you freer in your manifestations. So you have to isolate yourself to some extent from the hyper-stimulating novelty. Novelty information and pleasures. Stop consuming content uncontrollably. Make time for books, courses, and tutorials rather than YouTube videos. Stop listening to music with headphones. Yes, it\'s very nice. But it also overstimulates your dopamine system. Don\'t listen to music all the time, go to a concert once every two weeks and get a truly deep buzz from music. What could be better than an instrumental concert after two weeks without music\? You don\'t give up on music\! You make it more meaningful to you. You will be able to truly perceive it. It\'s the same with the news. We will touch on this topic later, but the news is designed in such a way as to drive you into a stupor. They do not carry useful information for you, They only occupy your mind. Isn\'t there room in your mind for better data\? Data that is related to your personal effectiveness\? People spend their whole lives watching TV or YouTube, looking at who is shooting at whom and which diplomat, how he responded to aggression, but this does not help them in any way. It drains their strength. News is a waste of time, tied to constant novelty, which also negatively affects the dopamine system. In general, people often resent why they should take away the natural right to go to the movies, play computer games and keep up with the global political agenda. The answer is very simple. This is not a natural right. Our ancestors in nature have never encountered such stunning things. How did our ancestors rest\? They walked in the woods, enjoyed nature, met friends, sat by the fireplace and read books, but they did not have access to such things. The entertainment of modern civilization simply milks us. Believe me or not, just removing all that stuff from your life is fun. You will change your life, you will turn it to a fundamentally different level.\n""\n""Another addition, do not share your plans. In fact, when you share your fantastic plans with others, you simply use up dopamine in vain. Relish what you haven\'t achieved yet. This can potentially lead to a drop in motivation. The person who keeps telling everyone about his plans and goals quickly loses interest in them. When you talk about your goal, besides, if it is grandiose, people start congratulating you on it. Thereby turning your goal into a social reality. In this case, the mind simply succumbs to a trick. And then the way you have already experienced satisfaction. The incentive to achieve goals is reduced. A few years ago, an experiment was conducted, several dozen people were specially selected, then they were given leaflets on which they had to write their goals.\n""\n""After that, everyone was divided into two groups. People from the first group spoke about their goals. People from the second group kept them to themselves. The results were amazing. People in the second group worked the full 45 minutes, and at the end of the experiment, they still wanted to continue working. People from the first group worked half the time, arguing that they felt much closer to the goal. So, if all this is true, then what to do\? You need to keep all the information to yourself and go clearly to the intended goal and experience real euphoria when the goal is achieved. But if you still want to talk about your plans, you can do it in such a way that you don’t get pleasure from it. For example, voice your plans like this: I definitely need to achieve this, so please kick me more often.\n""\n""Step number five is cyclical fasting and seclusion. The main ingredient in the dopamine reset is intermittent fasting. During hunger, our body produces the hormone ghrelin. This is one of the most powerful antidepressants, and it also significantly improves the functioning of the dopamine system. So yes, if you are experiencing sugar cravings after fasting for 24 hours, this will calm you down. Among other things, intermittent fasting improves insulin sensitivity. And this, apart from other factors, improves the functioning of the dopamine system. Intermittent fasting can be done in different ways. If you are an endomorph prone to fullness, it can even be done every week for 24 hours. If you are a mesomorph, fast once every two weeks. And if you are slender and have a thin bone, as I have enough once a month for a day. But regardless of your type, abstinence from food is a very powerful recovery tool for all body systems, hormonal, food and others.\n""\n""During fasting, you can only drink water. Try it, It\'s a very powerful skill. For the dopamine reset, I used fasting quite often, and it helped me cope with stress. You can also include another reboot item here. I consider it very important. It allows you to speed up the reboot process. If you\'ve ever tried fasting, you\'ve noticed how delicious food seems to be when you sit down at the table for the first time after fasting. I have already explained that this is due to the fact that the receptors of the tongue are partially cleared. The same principle applies to every other aspect of our lives. If you are socially starving, secluded in nature for a day or two, then, returning to society, you begin to feel people more subtly. It immediately becomes clear who you need and who you don\'t need. You begin to appreciate communication. You rarely want to say meaningless words. In short, social life is filled with meaning. And this story is not only about food and society. Anything can be included there. Haven\'t watched movies in six months. Then you turn on a black and white Soviet film, and it absorbs you so that it blows you away better than any 3D. Or, for example, you work on a stool for half a year, then sit down on a chair and experience such a wild buzz that you never felt before sitting in front of the fireplace in some kind of softening chair. Happiness is relative. Breaks are needed for everything. To feel something good, you must first limit yourself from this good thing. I think the general principle is clear. So I did something similar from time to time with every aspect of my life. Sometimes I refuse food, sometimes movies, sometimes society, sometimes work, and so on. And I advise you to do the same. The principle of fasting is the main principle of the dopamine reset."
</string>
    <string name="d4d6">"Step number six. Meditation. Meditation is the most powerful dopamine reboot booster. How does he work\? It is not so important. It\'s important that it works. However, I will talk about this in other lessons. Through meditation, a person learns to pay attention to his feelings, to his thoughts, urges, impulses, to his impulsiveness. And if you can notice these things at the level of the mind, then it is easy to cope with them. Thus, everything in your life takes on some meaning. It becomes easier for you to control yourself. So I advise every person who seeks self-development to meditate at least 10 minutes a day. Time is not so important, consistency is important. Many books have been written on the subject, and I will not take the time of this study to go into more detail about meditation techniques. Personally, I focus on the sensations in the body, on the breath and on my position in space. For example, in the book “The Power of the Subconscious” by Jody Spinoza, one wonderful technique of meditation is very well described. But if for some reason you don\'t like to meditate or you don\'t have time, use the mindfulness technique. Its essence is to feel yourself in the present moment. It is described very well in the Dzogchen teaching. You can read it on the Internet or in specialized books. But I will try to tell you my author\'s instrument. How do I personally use this technique. Personally, I use it while walking. After all, when we walk, thoughts also begin to walk. First, I straighten my back. From the coccyx to the top of the head, a straight line should form, extending into the sky. Secondly, I remove tension from the muscles. This does not mean that you need to relax your legs and fall while walking. This means that it is necessary to feel where and in which muscles there are excessive tensions. Check all the muscles from the forehead to the heels. Take an inner look at all the smallest muscles and release excess tension. Thirdly, I will defocus my eyes. we are accustomed to focusing our vision on objects, but try to expand your vision. Your vision should cover 180 degrees around you. Relax your eyes, don\'t cling to anything. Fourthly, I begin to follow my breath and do not try to change it. I just watch my breath.\n""\n""When all four conditions are met, you will feel how your perception has changed. Thoughts will not go away, but they will be realized. Mind calm down. You will gain confidence and relaxation. This is called meditation. While walking, it is even more powerful than regular meditation, but requires more concentration. Use it if you don\'t have time to meditate. As I said, we will touch on this topic in even more detail when we talk about neuroplasticity. For now, that\'s enough.\n""\n""Step number seven. Quality sleep and rest. At the beginning of the dopamine reboot, you need to make sleep full. Lack of sleep leads to a sharp decrease in dopamine receptors. You need to sleep about 8 hours at night. And if possible, you can take a nap for 10 - 20 minutes and in the afternoon until 15:00. Consistent quality sleep on a schedule is something that is absolutely essential for normal functioning and the dopamine system. If I start describing how your dopamine system goes astray, if you fall asleep with a smartphone in your hands, you will simply be horrified. The same with unstable and ragged sleep patterns. I just can\'t underestimate the importance of this issue. Sleep regulates all processes in the body. And if you want to have hope for the health of the dopamine system, then it is absolutely essential to have a strict sleep schedule. The ideal is to go to bed at 10:00 - 11.30, and wake up at 5:00 - 6:00. At the same time, 2 hours before bedtime, do not look at any screens, and meet the morning with a look to the east. Looking at the light in the morning is one of the most important conditions for a healthy dopamine system. Woke up\? Greet the sun as our ancestors did. That\'s why I\'m a big fan of nature and the dopamine system reboot in non-urban environments. You need to sleep in a dark, quiet room with access to fresh air. In general, you can do a separate course about sleep. There are a lot of nuances here. But for now, enough of what has already been said. Ragged mode is something that is completely incompatible with a healthy lifestyle and dopamine system.\n""\n""Step number eight. Daily cold shower. Yes, it may seem crazy to you now, but it is actually a very powerful tool for increasing dopamine. For example, taking a shower with a temperature of 17°C, you can increase the secretion of dopamine and norepinephrine by 250% and 530%, respectively. Is it possible to imagine a tool more powerful than this\? Personally, I started taking cold showers at five seconds. Now I can stand under an ice shower for quite a long time and not experience negative sensations. Yes, it took me six months to get there. But even a short time in a cold shower will increase the secretion of dopamine. However, do not overload yourself with cold. Everything should be in moderation. You shouldn\'t get cold. It won\'t help.\n""\n""Step number nine. Sports loads. Scientists have proven that the most effective way to dramatically increase the level of dopamine and norepinephrine in the blood is physical activity. And the change happens within minutes of jumping on the bike. Just by crouching a couple of times during work, you significantly improve the work of the dopamine system. This even works for seriously mentally ill people, such as those suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This effect lasts only an hour and a half, reducing the negative symptom in patients. Special medications last up to 12 hours. But we don\'t want side effects, right\? It’s better to just train consistently and enjoy the high dopamine. Sports and cold showers will help you lose weight. And this is good. After all, there is a strong relationship between excess fat and the work of the dopamine system. Obese people have much fewer dopamine receptors. And in general, their brain on the tissues looks like the brain of a drug addict. But I already spoke about it. No offense, friends, this is the reality. Fortunately, this is not a death sentence, and by losing excess weight, you can significantly improve your willpower.\n""\n""Well, this is a small list of how and under what conditions you need to do a dopamine reset. As you progress, you\'ll learn more details and figure out how to do it most effectively. But for now, let\'s finish."
</string>


    <string name="d5d1">"So, friends, now we will talk about proper nutrition to maintain and restore the dopamine system. We discussed what to remove from your diet. Now let\'s talk about what you need to add to your diet.\n""\n""Step one, decoctions. Decoction of ginseng. Decoction and ginseng have a positive effect on the work of the dopamine system through the impact on some genes, and also has a positive effect on dopamine receptors. A decoction of Rhodiola rosea. This is a great way to increase dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine levels. I use these decoctions once a week, for example, I drink Rhodiola rosea decoction on Monday. And on Wednesday or Thursday I drink a decoction of ginseng.\n""\n""Step two. Sprouts. Broccoli sprouts are high in sulforaphane. Sulforaphane is a substance that protects dopamine receptors. It, of course, performs a huge number of functions, is anti-cancer. And in principle, I recommend to every person, regardless of the state of his dopamine system, to grow broccoli sprouts. So if possible, grow broccoli sprouts and add them to salads. This will positively affect the health of the dopamine system and, in general, the health of the whole organism. It\'s not that hard to do. Seeds can be ordered online, and you can even grow them in a jar. I recommend about 50 grams of sprouts per day. This is an extremely powerful tool for all areas of human life, not only for the dopamine system.\n""\n""Step three. Antioxidants. Dopamine is endowed with the ability to quickly oxidize. Therefore, we need a lot of antioxidants to fight the effects. The coolest food in terms of antioxidants is berries: blueberries, blueberries, strawberries, blackcurrants, strawberries, and so on. All berries are suitable. They can be frozen, dried, bought in the store, it doesn\'t matter. The main thing is that they are and that there are enough of them. Some seasonings are also suitable for us, for example, cloves and cinnamon. You should also include as many colorful vegetables and fruits as possible: beets, carrots, dark green leafy plants such as spinach, and red cabbage. Well, complete the whole thing with mushrooms in small quantities. It is also worth adding walnuts and, in general, diversifying the diet with local products as much as possible. Try to eat locally grown foods that are high in antioxidants.\n""\n""Step four. Additives. I am making this section for informational purposes only. Personally, I do not use any supplements, except for very few. But if you need, if you think it is necessary, and if you have studied this issue in depth, then you can apply. However, I do not recommend this. My approach is purely natural. I believe that the supplements that have been invented in the modern world are either not fully understood or are not reliable. So I leave it at your own risk. From this list, I do not recommend almost anything, except for what I personally used myself. But I will talk about this separately. There are various additives, for example, L - tyrosine, L - thionine, beta alanine and others. Beta alanine increases the secretion of serotonin and generally improves the functioning of the dopamine system, while blocking the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine. So from time to time you can take this supplement, which is sold in almost any sports store. There is nothing particularly terrible about her. But I would not use it on a permanent basis, but, say, during the week I would use it during the reboot, and then I would take a break of three to four weeks. Maybe even a month or more, and then take another week and be done with it altogether. Mucuna burning or Mucuna slot. This plant grows in India, has a huge number of positive effects. Personally, I have tried this supplement and it is very powerful, improves everything\! You need to use courses and on business. Any hyperconsumption is harmful, especially for powerful things like Mucuna. I advise you to study this topic on your own. You can see a list of worthy brands below. You can buy them on the Internet. And this is not an advertisement. Moreover, as I said, you can easily do without any additives. At the beginning, when I listed the supplements, I mentioned this L - tyrazine. It can be replaced in principle with legumes. For example, lentils. A, L - thionine can be taken from green tea, that is, it is commonplace to brew green tea for yourself. Another supplement is Ginkgo Biloba, a pretty powerful stuff that works very well on dopamine and potentially on serotonin. Like any supplement, it is worth using it wisely, having previously studied the reviews and compatibility with other drugs. Now to those additives that can be used absolutely always. The largest thing, which is called ginger, deserves special attention. First, there is a whole bunch of antioxidants that we talked about above. And about a hundred phytonutrients. It also, regardless of these factors, improves the functioning of the dopamine system and other important neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. Buy yourself golden ginger and add it to salads, tea and decoction. This is delicious. Oregano oil. Another thing that needs our attention. It improves the functioning of the dopamine system, helps in depression through the regulation of dopamine and prevents its breakdown. You can add a teaspoon from time to time, say, in salads. Curcumin. Buy yourself ground turmeric, mix it with black pepper, in a ratio of one part black pepper to eight parts turmeric, and then add it to salads and other dishes. Turmeric improves and regulates dopamine receptors. Barberine. Barberine is the active ingredient in barberry. Barberine inhibits an enzyme that prevents the conversion of tyrosine to dopamine. Personally, I didn’t buy barberine separately, but I consistently make a decoction from barberry. That is, if somewhere you have the opportunity to buy or grow your own barberry, you can harvest it for the winter and make decoctions from it. The following supplement is absolutely essential for everyone. This is vitamin D3. In theory, it is produced in the sun. But due to the fact that there is not so much sun in some countries, it should be taken separately all year round. Vitamin D3 helps the dopamine system work, fights addictions and improves brain function in general. I would advise taking about 2000 units per day of vitamin D3 daily. And live a happy life. But it\'s best to just be in the sun. Another vitamin to take on a regular basis is vitamin B12. More than 40% of the population in developed countries is deficient in B12. We used to get it from water and plants that grow on clean soil. But now it\'s gone. So it is advisable to take supplements. Low B12 levels negatively impact dopamine and serotonin. Probably everything on supplements. Omega three fatty acid supplements could also be mentioned.\n""But I prefer to get Omega 3 from food. What will we talk about next. But if you still want to take Omega Three separately, then please, no one bothers. Something like DHA omega three fatty acids or krill oil will be good for your dopamine system. Considering that almost everyone is currently deficient in omega-3s, this might be something you should consider.\n""\n""Step five. Now let\'s move on to nutrition. Before describing the power system, I will tell you how everything works. Dopamine is a mono-amine neurotransmitter. It is synthesized from a single amino acid, tyrosine. And you, therefore, might think that you need to eat foods that are very high in tyrosine in order to have more dopamine, naturally. But it is not so. For example, the largest amount of tyrosine is found in eggs, chicken, pork, beef, fish and other animal products. However, there are many other amino acids in animal products that compete to enter the brain. Imagine huge queues at a nightclub. Everyone wants to go to the party. However, they have very little time, and only elite companies, well-organized party-goers, penetrate the club. With amino acids, the same thing, if you eat some animal product, then there are so many other amino acids in it that the amino acid that you need. that is, tyrosine simply cannot get into the brain. It is believed that high-protein foods should be avoided so as not to interfere with the development of levodopa. From this it follows that the source of tyrosine for us will be plant foods. The foods we need are bananas, avocados, walnuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, beans, sesame seeds. Add a couple of bananas to your diet and you will be fine. I also really love walnuts. In general, they fit very well into a harmonious diet. They are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, for example. Animal products, if you eat them, it is advisable to eat separately so as not to interfere with the absorption of tyrosine. Another way to increase levodopa levels is with insoluble fiber. Its consumption significantly increases the level of levodopa in the blood and improves its bioavailability. Therefore, you need to eat a lot of vegetables, fruits, berries, mushrooms, legumes and grains. One after another, various studies come to the same conclusion. The consumption of vegetables and fruits significantly affects psychological health. Scientists are coming to understand that, statistically, the more fruits and vegetables you eat, the more likely you are to rate your mental health as: very happy. Moreover, regardless of the status of the place of residence, mobility, occupation, family, race and other factors. In England, for example, during a study of more than 80,000 people, it turned out that by measuring the amount of plant foods in a person’s diet, literally by grams, one can predict how much happier a person will be in the near future. More fruits and vegetables, more joy. The happiest people in the study were those who ate seven servings of fruits and vegetables a day. But how can vegetables and fruits themselves have such an effect\? It turns out that a lot depends on antioxidants, on vitamins C, E and F. A sense of optimism, goals in life and the desire to live increase in those who prefer a mostly plant-based diet. And scientists say that this is precisely because of the high content of antioxidants in their diet. In another study, scientists are already more clearly saying what happiness is and define specifically what it includes: involvement in life, a sense of higher meaning and purpose in life, creativity and curiosity. For this, as you understand, the dopamine system is responsible. And here is what was found. The more plant foods people ate, the more these indicators became. Interesting and the opposite effect. The happier a person is, the more he wants fruits and vegetables. It turns out that the better your mood, the more likely you are to choose an orange instead of chicken. However, food comes first. What you eat is what you will be.\n""\n""In one study, researchers gave subjects a particular food today and measured the next day to see how their psychological state had changed. A direct relationship was found. Eat a plant, improve your mood. Scientists sum up the consumption of vegetables and fruits improves mood. So I advise everyone. There are vegetables and fruits. Let\'s look at a couple more studies that will surely be of interest to you. In one study in 2012, it turned out that among the elderly, it is those who suffer more from depression who have few antioxidants in their blood, eat fewer vegetables and fruits than others. Scientists, of course, decided to confirm their findings and for six years they monitored the nutrition and psychological state of the elderly. It turned out that it is really possible to successfully cure depression by simply adding fruits and vegetables to food. Similar experiments were carried out on the Taiwanese. It turned out that for old people, the more fruits and vegetables they ate, the happier they were, regardless of social status, profession and all that. If you eat a large portion of fruit, at least three times a week, the chance of becoming depressed is reduced by 34%. And if these are vegetables, then it is 66%. Particular attention should be paid to the Amaryllis family. In Kazakhstan, this is garlic and green onions. They increase the level of glutathione, which is very good for the work of the dopamine system. However, I do not advise you to eat raw garlic. It is advisable to process it thermally and only then make sauces out of it, which are already poured over salads. In your diet, try to focus on plant foods. It is advisable to make a rule for yourself with every meal, eat a salad or something raw, vegetable. For example, you can eat berries for breakfast with porridge, broccoli for lunch, and salad for dinner. Another extremely important point is food with a low glycemic index. I will give the table in the description of the lesson. Try to eat unprocessed foods that don\'t cause insulin spikes. The simplest: just remember how your ancestors ate. It was simple, unprocessed, oven-cooked food at home. And in the summer it was fruits, vegetables and root vegetables that were grown in the local environment. Try to stick to these rules more often, be in the sun, breathe fresh air and monitor your stress levels. All this together will make your dopamine system healthy and you disciplined. So let\'s sum it up. Food should be low-glycemic. That is, it should not contain any sugar or any processed foods. It should be mostly whole grains, not flour. Use those additives that I said, but in moderation and not so often. Eat more antioxidants. Use sprouts and drink decoctions. Even every single moment of all of the above can significantly improve the functioning of your dopamine system. Therefore, introduce them gradually, step by step. No need to pounce on all the decoctions, all the additives. You do not need to completely change your diet in one second. Do everything gradually, and you will see the result."

    <string name="d5d2">"Now I will talk about some habits that are desirable to implement to maintain a healthy dopamine system and, as a result, stable motivation, achieve goals and be disciplined. Let\'s start with the nutrition issue. I will go over what we have already said in more detail and summarize a little.\n""\n""Firstly, in order for tyrosine to reach the brain, you need consistently good levels of insulin and a large amount of tyrosine in relation to other amino acids. To do this, you need to use plant sources of protein for the most part, avoid sugar, refined and squeezed oils, processed foods and processed foods. Let\'s assume that we set up our diet and amino acids and tyrosine pass through the barrier and enter the brain. After that, the brain needs a few things to make dopa from tyrosine, from which dopamine will be synthesized later. First, you need folic acid, iron and oxygen. Where can you get all this\? Folate is found in bulk in legumes, leafy greens, citrus fruits, and other plant foods. For better absorption of iron, a little lemon juice can be squeezed from plants onto the product. And finally, oxygen. You need to be in nature more often and play sports on the street. The next moment, in order to make dopamine from dopa, vitamin B6 is needed. I get vitamin B6 in my diet from bananas, legumes from vegetables and fruits, and a whole bunch of other foods. Thus, everything related to nutrition, we have closed. If you summarize everything that I said about nutrition, then the conclusions are simple. More plant foods, more variety, and less processed, less refined, and less fat.\n""\n""And now, when it is more or less clear what you need to eat, let\'s touch on other aspects that are no less important. I would say that nutrition is 1/3 of what needs to be considered.\n""\n""Super habit number one. Sun. Probably one of the most important things that opened up to me when I studied the topic of dopamine and motivation closely is the sun. Notice that in the summer you have more motivation, you have a better mood, you are better motivated, and you want to live more. It\'s not just like that. This is because the sun is around you. However, now we are taught to think that the sun is a complete harm, they say, it causes skin cancer and so on. I\'m not going to dispute these statements in this course yet, but only to say that everything is much more complicated. For example, people wear sunglasses. The glasses block only certain UV rays. Because of this, our brain does not seem to understand what is happening, because of which melanin, which is the protector of the skin, is not produced. Therefore, when a person walks down a hot street, naked, but in sunglasses, then, in fact, he exposes himself to additional risk. The same applies to sunscreens. The same applies to the light regime in which we now live. So with the sun, everything is much more complicated. And therefore it is not entirely important how you feel about sunbathing and the sun in general. One thing is for sure, avoiding the sun is signing your dopamine death warrant.\n""\n""Fact. The best thing you can do for your dopamine is wake up to the sunrise. Morning sunlight until 11 - 12 hours, start all the processes in the body. For 5 billion years, our organisms have evolved under conditions of solar radiation. And our circadian rhythms are wildly tied to daylight hours. Our blood, mitochondria, our cells, all respond to solar radiation and begin to act accordingly. The habit of our ancestors to meet the sunrise before breakfast is not so strange. When it\'s morning, we first of all look at the sun, more precisely, at the sky, or we are just on the street. This causes the secretion of dopamine and sets the body up for subsequent work. Working in the sun is also a good idea. Well, or, at least, to be on the street more often and take sunbaths. This has a positive effect on the work of your dopamine system, and indeed on the body as a whole. But like I said, don\'t wear sunglasses. No need to hide from nature. You will only make yourself worse. Well, if not to yourself, then to your dopamine system for sure. Among other things, when your skin is in the sun, it synthesizes vitamin D. Vitamin D itself plays a huge role in the synthesis of dopamine. It can be obtained either from special supplements or by being in the sun, which is better. Its deficiency leads to disruption of the dopamine system. In general, I have already mentioned this vitamin, but I want to draw your attention to the fact that this is probably one of the few vitamins that you really need to take, especially for the health of the dopamine system.\n""\n""The second super habit is sports. Imagine the life of our ancestors, and it will become clear to you what the ideal lifestyle for a healthy dopamine system is. Mobility, exercise, sport and plowing. Training has an extremely positive effect on activitydopamine and dopamine receptors. Sometimes several times. And in general, for all mono-amine neurotransmitters, charging has a positive effect. You can feel it literally within an hour. Aerobic exercise is especially good: walking, running, swimming for long distances, and so on. But scientists associate the lack of movement with a reduced activity of motivation centers. Therefore, every day you devote a significant amount of time to sports activities or at least walks in nature. Scientists have proven that walking in nature also improves the dopamine system.\n""\n""The third super habit is cold treatments. Cold showers are a great way to stimulate the dopamine system. You can raise your dopamine by as much as 530%. Personally, I take a cold shower every morning. This is wildly motivating. Learn the Wim Hof \u200B\u200Bmethod. It will allow you to engage in contract procedures without difficulty and fear.\n""\n""The fourth super habit is healthy sleep. You sleep badly, you kill the will to live. No sleep schedule, killing the dopamine system. You deprive yourself of sleep, you sign the dopamine receptors. We again come to the same thing. It\'s not the lack of discipline that prevents you from going to bed on time, but rather the fact that you don\'t go to bed on time deprives you of self-discipline. Set yourself a sleep schedule and always follow it, spending at least 7 to 8 hours in bed. However, here again it is very important to let the body know when you woke up and when you fell asleep. During evolution, he learned about this by reacting to the sun\'s rays. In today\'s world, we are acting very stupidly. Falling asleep and waking up under the blue light of our screens. Blue light kills your brain. And Dot. Just stop sitting at the computer when you don\'t need to. Stop touching your phone, especially in the morning and evening, waking up, go outside or on the balcony, meeting the sun, and falling asleep, look at the sunset. This will restore your circadian rhythms and greatly improve your sleep quality, which in turn will, of course, improve your dopamine system.\n""\n""The fifth super habit is meditation. According to recent research, meditation increases dopamine and makes the dopamine system healthier. And meditation along with yoga modulates the dopamine system, improving it in the long run. You don\'t have to sign up for any courses. You can independently study the practice and do it instead of charging and stretching. I myself do this every morning, as well as ice showers and meditation. She charges me with wild energy and motivation for the whole day ahead.\n""\n""I think five habits will be enough. The average person may well bring them into their lives. Maybe not immediately, but gradually, one by one. But it should be done\! Their effectiveness has been proven by many scientific studies, including my personal experience. So: meditation, sun exposure, sports, cold treatments and quality sleep."

    <string name="d6d1">"So, we talked about the dopamine reset. I hope that in general terms you understand the essence of this practice and feel it for yourself. Again, in the plan after all these dopamine lessons, you will find detailed, step-by-step actions for dopamine reset and everything that comes with it. But this is not the end of the matter. Dopamine will serve us still very much. So, in 2011, a study was published stating that dopamine functions as the primary gateway for habit formation. Scientists say that dopamine speeds up the formation of both good and bad habits. For us, this is a window of opportunity. There is a simple thing to understand here. We do everything for pleasure. We are somewhat like rats. Once scientists conducted an experiment, forced rats to perform tasks. If the rat coped with the test, with the help of an electric shock, they gave a signal to the brain, as a result of which dopamine was produced. The rat felt satisfied. And so it went on from time to time. In the end, the rat felt very clearly. If you do good, it will be good. And even when the scientists no longer used electric shocks, the rat still enjoyed doing the task. In this way, the rats developed absolute discipline and a desire to act. As I said, our consciousness works in exactly the same way. All animals, including humans, instinctively seek pleasure and try to avoid “stress”. We need to turn this system around 180 degrees and make sure that short-term “tension” is associated with pleasure in our body. Yes, you understood correctly, we will train ourselves. So, to link difficulty and joy, there are three approaches: physical, mental, and emotional. We will use all three of these channels to maximize the feeling of joy after the work done.\n""\n""Everything starts before work. Placebo Institute researcher Ted Kapchik discovered in his scientific research that if a sick person is given a “placebo”, claiming that the medicine will help him, dopamine is immediately produced. This tells us that simply believing in success can cause the small bursts of dopamine that are so important to us. Remember, we need a steady, small amount of dopamine throughout the day, and for it to be related to our activities. So Faith is our main tool. Therefore, before work, you need to truly believe in what you are going to do. First, formulate a clear goal, and then make a conscious decision and complete the task. If you do this constantly, then the so-called goal reflex is formed. It doesn’t matter what you have achieved, whether you have finally reached the store or defended your doctoral dissertation. The achievement of any goal puts the pleasure centers into holiday mode. And when you achieve your goals every day, this same goal reflex is formed when your body feels pleasure in advance. You just set a goal, for example, to write a text, and your brain already feels motivated.\n""\n""Secondly, you need to charge yourself emotionally. Imagine, in all its glory, the result to which you are going. This is something very large-scale, beautiful, big, but, nevertheless, achievable. Visualize the picture of the future: Where are you going\? What is the end of your work\? Charge yourself with emotions. Get up, walk with your whole body, feel what awaits you\! And now think about the fact that the action that you are now going to start is just the first steps towards that goal. These goals do not have to be ambitious. Let it be small things. For example, I set a goal to take out the trash. Then I deliberately go and throw out the garbage. The brain sees: Yeah, the owner set a goal and fulfilled it. I activates the pleasure center. After a hundred of these trips with garbage, I have a goal reflex. And I automatically feel motivated when I go to take out the trash. Feel free to set even the smallest and most insignificant goals. Write a text on two pages. The goal is to cook dinner for the family, the goal is \?, and so on. Don\'t spare your goals. I will repeat again. There should be many goals in all spheres of life. When you have only one big goal, dopamine becomes extremely vulnerable. So the more hobbies and activities you have, the better. Research shows that simply imagining your future self increases your discipline. In one of these studies, not very active people were taken. The first group was asked to think about their future in bright, pleasant colors. The second group, on the contrary, thought about their future in negative terms, while the third group did not think anything. It turned out that both the second and the first group began to exercise more after the study. Whereas in the third group no changes were observed. There were other studies as well. For example, in 2010, scientists found that those students who visualized the results of their exams solve 60% more problems than those who did not. Therefore, it is a good idea to imagine before each action what positive consequences: whether it is your action or inaction. For example, yes now I will not drink tea with sugar, but in the future it will change my life. Or yes, now I\'m just going to take a cold shower, and IA little unpleasant.\n""\n""But in 1000 generations, it will change life in the entire universe. In short, come up with something of your own, some pleasant thought. I want to note that this is a very powerful tool, and it works in full force after a dopamine reboot. Indeed, in the normal state, if your dopamine system is upset, the receptors will not even feel a surge of motivation. So yes, you will notice a special effect only after a reboot. After it, you will react very sharply to emotional motivation. Goosebumps will run through your skin, and you will feel a keen desire to get to work. This is the first stage of habit formation through the production of dopamine. But I would like to warn you. You don\'t have to be crazy motivated. This is a very good tool, but it can be harmful. If you start daydreaming about the future, beautiful castles and sleeping beauty, that in itself can become a bad habit. Imagining the future triggers the release of dopamine. So after emotional motivation, you just need to get started. Positive thinking is necessary, in terms of dopamine theory, to properly motivate good mood and mental health. However, you should not abuse it and purposefully wind up your dopamine to the point of psychosis with the help of long repeated scrolling, dreams and beyond ideas. To avoid falling into this trap, follow a few rules.\n""\n""1. After motivation, there must always be action.\n""\n""2. Motivation should aim to expand your capabilities, not to bring pleasure and relieve discomfort.\n""\n""3. Motivation should not be called in a row and repeatedly.\n""So, before doing it, you set yourself a specific task, charge yourself emotionally and realize what this action will lead to in the future. And then get right down to business.\n""\n""The second important point is that dopamine is very fond of time frames. If you have a clear schedule, then do is produced in significantly large quantities. If the task is spread out over time, this is no good. The body will not feel the need to fulfill it now. Therefore, when getting down to business, make sure that you are limited in time. You must have a daily schedule that you stick to. Use a timer and calendar to keep yourself on track. In fact, even something as simple as taking out the trash can be done quickly. Some people get dressed, go out with a slow checker, reach the trash can, throw it out and come back. And at the same time they think that they are wasting their time. You try to do it differently. Quickly packed up, threw out the trash, quickly returned. Very nice to do the right thing quickly. I am, of course, exaggerating with this example. But if you have a time frame for everything you do, it will only speed up the process of discipline formation. Let me give my example. Let\'s say I make it a habit to do my homework every day after school. I set myself a daily 2 hours for study and sit down to work always, at the same time, finishing exactly after 2 hours and trying to complete the task completely. Before starting work, I imagine that I will have a lot of A’s, and subsequently a great job with a salary of $10,000 a month. I visualize that all my tasks are realized, imagining how many people I helped and how many different and interesting things I learned. After that, I sit down and do my homework. At the end of the work, I make a note in my daily plan: the job is completed. This triggers the production of dopamine and forms my discipline, increasing the future motivation to study tomorrow and in a week. And here we come to the end of the work. So I finished my homework. What\'s next\? How to fix that result\? This is the final and probably the most important stage: the reward. Before the dopamine reset, you could watch some stupid movie or play some game or eat a huge cake as a reward. But now you get to enjoy the little things. Therefore, even simple relaxation will serve as a reward for you. Personally, I have found a great way to reward myself: walking. I go outside, breathe the air, smile and enjoy life. Because of the high dopamine and the normal functioning of the dopamine system, every now and then I come across cats walking under the sun, birds are constantly singing around, and I can hear them, and the wind blows pleasantly from all sides. You, too, will get great pleasure from such a reward. When your dopamine system returns to normal, of course. But in general, here, of course, and something else can be, to your taste. I will not impose my habits. However, it should be something simple, always available to you. Do not reward yourself with candy or computer games. Don\'t make this mistake. This will be hyperstimulation. You didn\'t do the dopamine reset just to slip back into nowhere. Reward yourself with something nice, but small. Hot bath, walk, dance, turn on your favorite music, massage, light sports, reading. In short, find something suitable for yourself. Understand that by reinforcing ourselves after achievements, we kind of reinforce the causal relationship for the dopamine system. Usually we achieve something, but we do not feel satisfaction. Here I am, for example, doing homework and a project. But since this homework has not yet been checked, my brain does not feel that I have done something useful, and next time it will have less motivation to act. Many workaholics fall into this trap. They exhaust their brains, but one day their brains just get depressed from a lack of dopamine. If you don\'t reach your goal, it exhausts the dopamine system and robs you of dopamine. It makes you apathetic. So your body should always feel what the hell it was plowing for the last 2 hours sitting in front of the computer\! After the reboot, the reward for you will be a simple rest. And rest is a change of activity. We worked at the computer, took a walk, have lunch, lie down in relaxation, take a shower, eat again, meditate. In a word, change the type of activity.\n""\n""So, the ideal training algorithm is as follows. First, I have a schedule. On every day. I wake up, and the first thing I see in front of me is the things that I will achieve my goals today. Before starting any task, I look at the list again and set myself a specific goal: in the next 2 hours I will search for scientific literature for the project. I imagine what wonderful consequences this action will have in the future, I charge myself with emotions and sit down to work. After finishing work, I turn off the computer, warm up, completely change the type of activity. For example, I go for a walk or take a contrast shower, and then I go to a meeting with a friend. A couple of months of such activity in the absence of stimulants like sugar, social networks, excess pleasure. And you will form an absolute discipline, you will crave work, you will like to work, you will wake up with burning eyes. I think this is the end of this lesson. And next we will continue. Thanks for your attention and good luck."

    <string name="d6d2">"One of the powerful things that works for me personally is a simple exercise. I will give my own example, but you can probably apply this model to your personal activities as well. So, the basis is this. You probably know that most people spend their whole lives in search of easy money, instead of actually earning money and investing their time and resources in long-term projects. We want fast, fat, tasty results. Entire industries are built on this, for example, lotteries or casinos. People go and buy a lottery ticket every day in the hope of winning 1,000,000. At the same time, their hope does not fade for a second. Strange, isn\'t it\? Why such amazing fanaticism\? It\'s all about dopamine, of course. When I was a child, there were slot machines everywhere that you could control with an iron hand to grab plush toys. It cost about 100 tenge. And so many of my friends spent hundreds of coins trying to get a toy and did it every day. One of them even saved on dinners in the hope of catching a toy. But it is very difficult. The iron hand turned out to be too slippery every time. It is very strange to watch a person trying to catch a toy, the cost of which is 500 tenge. At the same time, spending much more. You will say nonsense. I\'ll say motivation. We motivate ourselves with a potential, quick fix: a feeling of luck rather than something that could very well happen. This is not at all the same as going to the store and buying the same toy. There is an element of the unknown, an element of surprise, a little risk. So why am I telling you all this\? And how exactly do I use this effect\?\n""\n""Before starting to do something, I consider all the potential semi-realistic outcomes of this action. For example, I sit down to do a project and think: this project may well win the competition if I\'m lucky. I will receive 1000000 tenge. It will give me a big increase and more chances to enter a foreign university. Is it really real\? Yes, even though the probability of such a development of events is only a couple of percent, but it is this couple of percent that makes us look for quick success. Tomorrow I will make a project, and it can fly in. That\'s what I\'m thinking about, you need to try to fix the following idea in your head: Now, if I try now, then there is every chance of an ideal outcome of events. And so, you can do with any business. For example, before doing something, you might think: some cool businessman can see the result of my work. This may interest him, and he will hire me for a permanent job. Sounds realistic and reasonable at the same time, right\? So why not motivate yourself with such a result\? The point here is not to pump yourself up with emotions and get into the business with burning eyes. We talked about this above, but this is a completely different topic. I\'m talking about something else now. This is when you dryly argue that such a possibility exists in principle. After all, those people who buy lottery tickets every day think about the same thing. Well, I don\'t think I\'ll win. But there is a possibility. But suddenly I\'m lucky. But what should I spend 100 tenge\? So you must include a certain element of randomness, remember that the universe knows how to present gifts. Yes, these gifts are rare, but they do happen. And the more often you use such a tool, the more automatically it becomes. You won\'t have to think about it next time. You will just get to work and you will already be motivated automatically. You will be like those people who buy lottery tickets only in a good way. And when the universe unexpectedly smiles at you, and you receive an unexpected gift in the form of winning a contest, an olympiad, or some other good luck: this is where real joy is born. You could say catharsis. And usually at this moment there is absolute confidence in the truth of one\'s path.\n""\n""So let\'s sum it up. I always remember about the element of randomness. I realize that now I spend only 2 hours on work, and tomorrow I will win the competition. No need to emphasize this, but recognize it as a possibility. Some people make the mistake of making this possibility their main motivation in life. Not the best choice, but as an auxiliary tool it is quite a good thing. And it helps me to recharge with additional motivation before a difficult block of work. Okay, I think I\'ve said enough already and provided a large number of basic and additional tools. On this, perhaps, the lesson on dopamine can be completed. The final dopamine lesson will contain a complete plan for restoring the dopamine system, including nutrition, lifestyle, principles, and basic tools. Well, on this I say goodbye to you. Thanks for your attention and good luck."

    <string name="d7d1">Now we will talk about another mono-amine neurotransmitter - serotanin. Serotonin and dopamine are very similar in structure, but perform two fundamentally different tasks. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter of motivation. He makes us want and strive. It is responsible for the feeling of anticipation of pleasure. We have discussed it in some detail, and now it is clear to you how important it is to have a well-tuned dopamine system in order to have iron motivation. However, this is not all. It is not enough just to be motivated to act, you also need to be able to control yourself. And the frontal cortex is responsible for this. The worse her activity, the less you can control yourself. For example, you may be very strongly motivated to do something. But motivation is a very abstract concept, it applies to all things. In other words, you may be motivated to do a job, but when you see a pie next to you, you are just as motivated to eat that pie. Because the impulse, primary, is of the same strength. Therefore, it is very important to have not only tuned dopamine, but also serotonin. What are we talking about now. Dopamine and serotonin just act as intermediaries in the work of the frontal cortex of the brain. Now I will explain what this means. You\'ve probably heard of the experiment in which four year old children are seated in a room in front of a cake. The experimenter puts a cake in front of the child and says: Now I will leave the room, baby, and you can eat this cake. But if you wait for my return, I will bring another cake, and you can eat two at once. Imagine how cool.\n" "\n" "As a result of the experiment, it turned out that children who endured longer than others achieved significantly more success in life. What was this experiment about\? About self-discipline and willpower. The higher the willpower, the greater the chances of success in life. And at the level of neurobiology, this is a tandem of dopamine and serotonin. We have already discussed the role of dopamine, and the optimal level of serotonin allows, as it were, to cancel the primary incentive to eat a pie. The better tuned the dopamine system is, the longer you can resist your impulse without straining or experiencing negative sensations. In order to understand what serotonin is for, understand a simple thing. In the experiment with children and cakes, in fact, the second cake, as it were, does not exist in the sense. The pie is only in the imagination of the child. It is only somewhere in the potential probability. That is, as a result of the experiment, it is no longer willpower that is revealed, but your ability to refuse something real, tasty and attractive. For what is only in your head. As a potential opportunity, the experiment turns out to what extent the child is able to resist what is available for the sake of what is abstract, but very important. In other words, no matter how you tune your dopamine system, and no matter how motivated you are to succeed, it is serotonin that turns on your consciousness. A well-tuned serotonin system is when a curvy, sexy blonde at the gym asks you out and you say no because you have a wife. If serotonin is low and dopamine is still high, just the opposite will happen, because the motivation is very high, and the primary stimulus cannot be canceled, because serotonin is low. Healthy dopamine is needed in order to be motivated towards simple daily goals and tasks. And serotonin in order not to break into animal instincts. If you have good dopamine, then you are motivated to do your homework. And if you also have good serotonin, then you can resist the urge to go out with friends or watch a movie instead. Of course, you can always make the right choice, but it is serotonin that makes this choice more possible and easier. You don\'t have to push yourself. Low levels of serotonin lead to impulsivity and aggression, addiction and depression. And that\'s how antidepressants work. They increase the level of serotonin, which, as it were, gives you more control over your own impulses. Signs of low serotonin, this is the inability to bring things to the end, slight irritability if something does not work out. And that\'s when you can\'t really make a plan and just follow it. Low serotonin, like with dauphin, can mean a whole bunch of things. For example, a small amount of serotonin released or malfunctioning of the receptors, or a small amount of the receptors themselves, or may mean that the serotonin released from the synapse returns very quickly to the neuron, and so on. Changing any of these indicators can increase or decrease serotonin, which will have a bad effect on your self-discipline, if your serotonin is too low, then you are most likely already tired of reading and want to quickly find out how to raise this very serotonin and live happy life. Especially for you, I tell you the simplest ways. It is to be in the sun more often, go to a massage therapist, eat the right food, exercise moderately more often and remember the positive events of your life. Well now, being satisfied, you can go to the second lesson and learn about it in more detail."

    <string name="d7d2">"So, friends, now we know that serotonin is very important. However, as with dopamine, the modern lifestyle has a wild effect on its production and normal functioning. This includes activity, nutrition, light regimen, stress levels, and more. All these moments that we used to consider the norm, in fact, are not the norm. We are only about three or four generations living in cities in exactly the conditions in which we live now. And our environment, in which we have evolved for 1,000,000 years, is extremely different from the one in which we now live. All this cannot but affect the health of dopamine and serotonin. Therefore, now we are forced to study separately what specifically negatively affects our serotonin and point to correct what we have already managed to break. As with dopamine, we will look at all known ways of modern science to restore serotonin. Let\'s start with the sun.\n""\n""We developed in nature, not in narrow little rooms. Our body is very accustomed to the sun. After all, sunlight solves a whole bunch of problems in our body. For example, it is under the influence of sunlight that our skin produces a hormone that everyone calls vitamin D for some reason. And vitamin D increases the secretion of serotonin. If you do not have the opportunity to be in the sun, then be sure to take vitamin D separately. The link is in the description of this lesson. Personally, I take vitamin D all year round. It is almost a must in our area and has a powerful effect on our health. Among other things, when sunlight enters your eyes, it increases the activity of serotonin. So you often visit the sunny streets of your city or, best of all, in nature. This will improve your serotonin. Experiments on rats, for example, show that sun exposure has the strongest effect on serotonin activity, and researchers in Canada have found that human serotonin levels are lowest during winter and highest during summer. In a word, it is possible to explain the biochemistry of serotonin and its relationship with the sun for a long time. But the point is the same. Be in the sun more often, and in the morning and afternoon, and in the evening. The more often, the better. It is advisable to dedicate 20 minutes or more to walks every day in the summer, and as much as possible in the winter. And, of course, never wear sunglasses.\n""\n""The next step is massage. Several studies have demonstrated how massage increases serotonin. One such study was conducted on pregnant women with depression. This is especially dangerous, because depression can adversely affect the health of the child. In two months, their serotonin levels increased by 30% and their stress hormone levels decreased by 31%. Another study was done on infants. They were massaged every day for 15 minutes for six weeks. As a result, their Sirotin grew by 34%. In short, ask your family to give you a massage or buy a subscription to a massage parlor. We kind of don\'t know how it works, but it works.\n""\n""Workout. I think it\'s no secret that sport is useful. And, probably, you have noticed more than once that after a workout or after a swim in the pool you feel happier. And the problems go somewhere and seem simple. Many studies show that it is aerobics and exercise such as yoga, long runs, cycling that significantly increase serotonin. Consistent hourly training once a week increases serotonin by 50% on average after two months. The best workouts are outdoor workouts versus indoor workouts. And outdoor activity works much better for increasing strength. However, remember that if you have low dopamine and don\'t feel motivated to exercise, you don\'t have to force it. It is unlikely to increase serotonin. Introduce sports into your life gradually. Make it a part of your routine, like brushing your teeth. Use a properly tuned dopamine system for this, as we discussed above. For example, I walk every day for 2-3 hours. This gives me both the sun and aerobic exercise. By the way, if you have such an opportunity, then walk on the ground without shoes. According to the latest research, the bacteria we come into contact with, when in contact with the earth, act as antidepressants on us. And, of course, increase the secretion of serotonin.\n""\n""The next item is good memories. Sounds very trite, but it works. You may be surprised, but remembering the good times is a really good way to keep your serotonin levels high, our thoughts affect the neurotransmitters. You think positively and your condition will be good. Yes, it’s good to be nostalgic and remember pleasant moments of the past. It will not only improve your mood, but also increase the activity of the dopamine system. The best practice is to set aside five 10 minutes a day solely for delving into pleasant memories. If thoughts go somewhere far away, just bring them back to the beautiful moments of the past. This practice leads to a significant increase in the secretion of dopamine, it can be combined with the practice of meditation, which we talked about in the part about dopamine. By the way, the practice of meditation itself increases the production of serotonin. It is believed that a brain with a low level of serotonin works as if at other wave frequencies. Meditation, as you probably know, changes them, promoting relaxation and potentially equalizing serotonin.\n""\n""In general, laugh more often, this increases Sirotin. Watch comedies and avoid horror. This is the best therapy for serotonin. And do not forget to add new positive events to your life, meet friends more often and have a good time. It also increases serotonin. I think we can end there.\n""\n""The next item is sleep. Like nothing new. Sleep is an absolutely essential component for the proper functioning of dopamine and serotonin. Yes, and in general for a normal life, too. However, people do not understand a little what normal sleep is. So I advise you to take the Sleepy Telegram bot course. If you suddenly go to bed always at different times and constantly wake up on an alarm clock, then you should pay attention to your sleep. Even a week of ragged sleep can seriously disrupt the serotonin system. Now, if I singled out the most important of all the points I have listed, then this would be one of them. Consistent, stable, deep and regular sleep is the foundation of a healthy dopamine system.\n""\n""And now let\'s pay a couple of moments, attention to those activities that destroy the serotonin system. Fortunately, they are very similar to the ones that destroy your dopamine. This is little sleep, alcohol, nicotine and other drugs, sugar and other simple sugars. Porn or social media addictions, stimulants like caffeine, and excess stress. As you understand, the pests are the same. So in any case, if you want self-discipline, you have to deal with these things.\n""\n""Day dream. Scientists have found that daytime sleep improves concentration. So if possible, take a break during the day. But you don\'t have to go to bed for 5 hours. No, as long as you keep a sleep schedule, you will need 10 to 30 minutes of sleep. The ideal time is from 13:00 to 15:00. You don\'t have to go to bed later. This can disrupt the nighttime sleep cycle. Personally, I do three times a week. In the middle of the day I go to sleep for about 10-15 minutes. Scientists believe that just such a short sleep of 5-10 minutes most strongly restores mental processes and provokes the secretion of the most important neurotransmitters.\n""\n""Now let\'s talk about nutrition. First, serotonin, just like dopamine, is a mono-amine neurotransmitter. This means that they are made from the same amino acid. In order to produce serotonin, our body needs a sufficient amount of tryptophan. That is, dopamine is made from tyrosine, and serotonin needs tryptophan. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid. That is, it is not produced in our body. So it must be obtained from food. Our brain uses this amino acid to make serotonin. But for this, it must first get into the brain, and before that it needs to be assimilated. Everything is exactly the same as with dopamine. And if we make the right diet, we can increase the amount of digestible tryptophan, and hence the production of serotonin. You can, of course, use nutritional supplements such as L - tryptophan. At one time, she gained particular popularity. True, after a while people began to die from it. This is a word about why I am skeptical about any supplements and prefer to do everything in a natural way. So, how do we increase the absorption of tryptophan\? Those of us who are nutritionally savvy know that tryptophan is abundant in, say, chicken and turkey or milk and many other animal products. However, back in 2003, scientists proved that the consumption of animal products for the sake of tryptophan is ineffective. The fact is that tryptophan is only one of the amino acids, and it competes with other amino acids to pass the so-called hematological barrier and enter the brain. But since there is less tryptophan in animal products compared to other amino acids, it is simply not allowed. Yes, the same story happens when you metabolize tyrosine to produce dopamine. And just like with dopamine, if there are plant-based foods, our body absorbs tryptophan more easily, and it will be the first in line to get into the brain. Already in 2007, scientists found that eating with animals and products increases the level of tryptophan in the blood, but reduces its amount in the brain. This means that you have a lot of fuel, but you can not use it. So, eating carbs, plant foods, increases brain tryptophan levels and improves your serotonin. That is why girls during the premenstrual period experience such cravings for sweets. Their brains require tryptophan to improve their mood. One study found that eating a high-carb, low-protein meal during premenstrual depression relieved symptoms of depression, anger, tension, sadness, laziness, and irritation. What does this tell us\? This suggests that if you want to improve your mood and work, eat less animal products, because after eating them, your brain simply does not have enough fuel to create the necessary serotonin. But it\'s not enough to just eat carbs. Here, too, there are nuances. So let\'s now look at the absolutely ideal nutrition for serotonin from the point of view of science. The ideal food for high serotonin is when it is high in tryptophan but low in other amino acids. And these are seeds: pumpkin, sesame, linseeds. Scientists conducted a detailed study, as a result of which it turned out that the consumption of these seeds does improve the objective indicators of social phobias, that is, those who experience discomfort in society. Before eating bean seeds and nuts, which are high in tryptophan, I suggest soaking them. And study this topic yourself, because it is very important to use these products correctly. Prior to these studies, intake of dietary tryptophan was not considered as a way to increase serotonin, as they simply did not find a relationship. But that\'s only because previous studies have given people animal protein. Now we know that it is vegetable protein and the use of carbohydrate foods that significantly improve the psychological state through serotonin. If this is true, then vegetarians, as it were, should be in a better mood than others. And so it is. After three weeks of a vegetarian diet, people have a better psychological state. It\'s all about the high carbohydrate intake and the huge ratio of tryptophan to another protein. In the study, people were asked to temporarily cut out meat, fish, and eat eggs and dairy products as much as possible. In just three weeks, their overall psychological state improved significantly. And other, larger studies are finding that plant-based people have much better moods and fewer symptoms of depression than omnivores. Just don\'t think. I do not at all urge you to become vegetarians or vegans, but only disclose data that may be useful to some of you. And you don\'t have to be a vegan to properly optimize your diet. Personally, having learned this data and deeply studied the topic, I began to really stick to more plant-based and reduced the proportion of animal products in the diet and, naturally, noticed a huge difference. So it\'s from personal experience. Consider also that the absorption of tryptophan into the blood increases after the consumption of carbohydrates. Therefore, at first we eat something that has a lot of tryptophan, and after two or three hours something more carbohydrate. By the way, a normal level of serotonin cannot be achieved if your insulin work is knocked down. So all the recommendations for sugar, fat, and processed foods that were laid out in the dopamine part still apply. The more natural food you eat, the better. Nature generally did not mean that you would squeeze oils and eat them in isolation. Nature did not mean that you would isolate sugar and eat it separately. And, of course, nature could never imagine that you would take a hundred products, grind them, process, mix, fry, steam, then pour them with sugar and fat, and then eat in huge volumes all day long. All this, of course, knocks down the work of insulin, which has been proven in 1,000,000 studies not only of insulin, but of the pancreas as a whole, which, in turn, of course, interferes with the absorption of tyrosine and tryptophan, which are so necessary for normal operation.\n""\n""So, let\'s sum up a little intermediate results. You need to avoid simple carbohydrates, that is, sugar, buns, bread, sweets and everything that we have already talked about more than once. Instead, eat complex plant-based carbohydrates such as fruits, brown rice, rye, and other grains. And also supplement them with the same high-grade proteins from the seeds of nuts and legumes. Try to eat animal food separately from other food and in smaller quantities. No need to mix meat with potatoes or bread. No need to eat animal products with other food. This literally kills tryptophan absorption.\n""\n""Let\'s go further. The next very important item in our diet is omega three fatty acids. It is especially important for serotonin. I would recommend taking omega-3s from plant sources such as walnuts or flaxseeds. Flaxseeds can be bought at any pharmacy. And before use, it is better to grind them in a coffee grinder. And already ready to add to your dishes, for example, salads or cereals. I am not a fan of this approach due to ethical reasons, but fish oil or some varieties of fish can be used as a source of Omega-3. So you can use them as well, if it suits you.\n""\n""We go further. It is very useful to drink a decoction of some special herbs. For example, a decoction of Rhodiola rosea slows down the enzymes responsible for the destruction of serotonin and dopamine. You can buy it at any pharmacy. It is, in fact, a natural adaptogen that enhances our ability to resist stress and naturally increase serotonin secretion. The second herb is St. John\'s wort. You can also buy it at a pharmacy. John\'s wort acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Because of this, it has long been known as a natural antidepressant. For this process, St. John\'s wort is responsible for the chemical compound - hyperfarin. Those who have more of this hyperfarin produce more serotonin. Scientists also believe that St. John\'s wort increases the number of serotonin receptors. So basically it\'s the perfect herb. But try not to get carried away with these herbs. All the same, these are therapeutic agents. For example, I brew these teas for myself twice a week, but not more often. They are good as an aid, but not the main one.\n""\n""Now let\'s move on to the next point. Vitamins are very important, especially vitamin B6. Good sources of vitamin B6 are bananas, avocados, legumes and sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, spinach, celery, and cauliflower. Vitamin B6 is responsible for the production of serotonin, dopamine and melatonin. So watch your intake of this vitamin especially carefully. Although, of course, all vitamins and minerals are important for normal physical and mental health. It\'s just that vitamin B6 directly creates serotonin. And so does dopamine. Turmeric is the largest spice, add it wherever you can. It is good for both dopamine, as I said in previous lessons, and serotonin. Mix turmeric with pepper in a ratio of 1:8. And it will increase its comprehensibility. It is also worth paying attention to Vitamin B12, although there are no direct indications that serotonin rises after taking B12. But people with depression very often have B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is found everywhere in nature, for example, in river water or in clean soil. But in the modern world, it is very difficult to get it. Therefore, 40% of the population of developed countries are deficient in vitamin B12. So just in case, take it. The link can be found in the description of the lesson. Among other things, it should be mentioned that most of the population of developed countries does not consume enough magnesium, so you should pay attention to this mineral. Moreover, scientists suggest that its amount directly affects the production of serotonin and improves serotonin in general. Where to take it\? Dark green leafy greens such as spinach and greens in general. For example, at the beginning of summer, you can eat greens from radishes. Later it will be greens from beets. The thing is very useful in itself, but also a good source of magnesium. There is also a lot of magnesium in pumpkin seeds, bananas, avocados and legumes. Yes, in fact, all the same products that I voiced earlier. So you don’t have to think too long about what kind of diet to make. But let me make a short list anyway. We need to figure out how to put all this into a big picture of nutrition to maintain serotonin and dopamine. I\'ll tell you with my own example. Once a week in the morning I brew myself a cup of St. John\'s wort or rose radiola. Before meals, I take two vitamins, vitamin D3 and vitamin B12. Then the first meal you can eat whatsomeday from pseudo-cereals, such as buckwheat, millet, amaranth or quinoa. In general, any food rich in tryptophan to your taste will do. And after that, after two or three hours, you can eat some kind of fruit, for example, bananas, kiwi or berries. There is a lot of vitamin B6, and this will improve the absorption of tryptophan, which you ate for breakfast. Then on to the third meal. It is advisable to add your omega three fatty acids. I have a big bowl of salad with greens and a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds and a handful of walnuts, which I can sometimes, for example, replace with pumpkin seeds, but walnuts are very good, because they have a lot of Omega three. Salad can be eaten with a plate of red beans. Cranberry beans are also good, which I love very much. It is extremely high in antioxidants. As the last meal, again, carbohydrates, clean food of your choice, whether it be porridge or fruit, is good. Please note that if you want to improve serotonin, then you should not eat protein foods at night. Here is an approximate picture of how you can build your nutrition to improve the serotonin system.\n""\n""Now let\'s add all this to an ideal lifestyle. After breakfast, you go for a walk outside for about an hour and a half and enjoy the sun, enjoying nature. During the day, you spend five 10 minutes on pleasant memories and the same amount on meditation. After a working day, you go in for sports, and after a workout, a person close to you gives a massage, after which you go to bed at the same time stably and without hitches, and wake up without an alarm because you just slept. This is the perfect picture for tuning the serotonin system. It may not be possible for everyone, but it is something to strive for. And even with a very busy regimen, the average person may well optimize his life to very close indicators, which I just announced. With a strong desire, of course.\n""\n""The last point is intermittent fasting. We already talked about intermittent fasting in the section on dopamine and fortunately, for improving serotonin, intermittent fasting is also very useful. I won\'t speak for a long time. Just to remind you, once a month you can fast for 36 hours. And on a daily basis, manage to fit all meals into a 12-hour or 10-hour window. Well, ideally, of course, an eight-hour window. Although, if you are used to eating a lot, then I think this will be unacceptable for you. Therefore, try to decrease in the 10 hour window. So, that seems to be all the recommendations for normal serotonin. Later we will collect all this into a general system of nutrition and lifestyle. And now let\'s continue further."
</string>


    <string name="d8d1">"Well, here we come to the final theme of this whole process. But let\'s start with the previous ones. Dopamine is the hormone of motivation. If your dopamine system is knocked down, you do not feel the need and desire to do simple, useful things and maintain discipline. You can change this with the help of the dopamine reset, which I have talked about in great detail. Serotonin is the pleasure hormone. If your serotonin system is knocked down, you cannot control yourself when you see some kind of stimulus: you see a delicious cake and immediately pounce on it, forgetting about the diet. It is possible to restore the serotonin system by introducing some of the right habits in lifestyle and nutrition, as well as after giving up the bad habits that I mentioned above. But the icing on the cake of discipline is when everything works automatically. Forming discipline, you all the same, one way or another, make certain efforts. You tense up, do a dopamine reset, deny yourself old habits and try to form new ones. But self-discipline becomes pleasant when all these processes are fine-tuned at the neural level. And you easily follow all these terrible restrictions without difficulty for yourself and easily take on work that you had to take on with strain before.\n""\n""During the day, every action requires our attention. And any process is launched precisely with the help of our attention. To move from one action to another, it is necessary to switch attention again. Here you are lying on the bed, then the hop switched his attention to the incoming message, then he paid attention to the weather outside the window, then he paid attention to the sweet bun that lies on the table, and so on. So, all our problems in life come from the fact that from time to time, again every day, we pay attention to the same things, while depriving attention of other things. We get irritated because we\'re not used to seeing the positives in a situation. We slide into negative actions that we try to quit. Since our attention automatically looks in a certain direction. In short, our personality is essentially what we are used to paying attention to. So that you can change the direction of your attention in order to re-educate yourself, to do something bad and in return to accustom yourself to something positive. There is a phenomenon of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is a term indicating the variable plastic nature of the brain. And it is with the help of neuroplasticity that we can change where we direct our attention. So, to change the personality, one\'s own consciousness and, of course, willpower, discipline and guidelines in life. Well, for example, you are looking at a table that has a lot of food, cakes, chips, sweets, buns and one apple. You are used to paying attention to anything, but not to an apple. You begin to salivate and now pounce on harmful foods. But after flashing the brain, you will automatically, without any effort for yourself, pay attention to the apple, and you will have a desire to eat it.\n""\n""And now about how it happens. Each tiny piece of the brain the size of a sand crystal contains about 100,000 neurons and more than 1,000,000,000 synapses that constantly communicate with each other and exchange information. All these neurons and synapses grow and increase in number with age. There are few of them in childhood, but the more experience we get, the more they become and the stronger the bonds become. For example, there is a neural network responsible for our experience in the morning. It has all possible options, anger, hatred, irritation, anxiety, despair. In short, a whole range of different emotions that turn on automatically in certain situations. And every time, waking up in the morning and experiencing some of these emotions, we sort of reinforce neural connections. We form new synapses and further strengthen our habit of feeling negative in the morning. But the brain of another person can be diametrically opposed. He can experience joy and inspiration every morning, regardless of external circumstances. It\'s just a matter of habit and where the owner of the brain wants to direct his attention. Neural connections have relationships. If you show the same reaction to some event every time, the neurons form a stronger connection, and it becomes part of your personality. If you experience joy every day, it also becomes part of your personality. Any actions, feelings, reactions and thoughts repeated from time to time become part of your personality, fixed at the neural level.\n""We create ourselves every day by our actions. As I said, the longer we live, the stronger the neural networks work, which means that the more effort is needed to reprogram these neural networks in our own way. If an optimist suddenly tries to explain to a 70-year-old pessimist that everything in the world is not so gloomy, he simply will never believe it. In his brain, the belief that everything is bad is a deeply formed, worked out, strong, fixed neural network. So many events in his life are connected with this conviction that to believe that everything is not so bad in this world is for him comparable to the loss of his personality. This will require some kind of break in the pattern, some incredible event that will absolutely prove to him that everything in the world really is not so bad. And before giving up, his brain will frantically rush through neurons and synapses, looking for suitable explanations for the events that have occurred. However, no matter how stubborn it may be, our brain can really change it. That\'s what neuroplasticity is for. Neuroplasticity is the breaking of old neural connections and the creation of new neural connections. This is the introduction of new elements into your life. We can change our beliefs to the exact opposite. We can completely change our way of life and even start taking it for granted. Forgetting how I lived before. We can get rid of bad habits completely and become the perfect version of ourselves. This is what neuroplasticity of the brain is for. It is difficult to do this, because we are no longer children, and in our head there are already clear attitudes, formed neural connections. You see a cake, you eat a cake and that\'s it. The problem is that many of our habits are so hard to recognize that it takes real work to understand why you salivate at the sight of a package, you need to pay attention to this and analyze this event. To understand why you are annoyed by the words of the interlocutor, even deeper work is needed. And to understand why you slip into bad habits from time to time, you need a real brainstorming session. I hope I have explained clearly. But just in case, I\'ll summarize. Neuroplasticity is the ability of our brain to destroy certain neural connections and replace them with other neural connections. This is a kind of flashing old installations and replacing them with a new one. This process is quite real and supported by modern science. In fact, neuroplasticity is the creation of stress for the brain, as a result of which it will, as it were, be forced to change the structure of neural networks. This is the learning process. In past lessons we have discussed how to make sure that we are motivated and what is needed so that you can easily resist the impulse\? And in this lesson, we will discuss how to change the brain at the level of neurons so that it becomes a habit and becomes a part of your life forever. Let\'s get started\!"
</string>
    <string name="d8d2">"Well, let\'s continue. But first I would like to recommend you one book that is very similar to this topic. It\'s called Mind and Brain, by Jeffrey Schwartz. And here we will talk about similar topics, but this book can really be useful to you, especially within this topic. So, according to the latest research, neuroplasticity scientists say the best place to start is to recognize the trigger - what starts your habit. Let\'s say you\'re used to playing computer games. The trigger to start a computer game is a shortcut, a stimulus on the desktop, or the computer itself, or even the room the computer is in. For every habit you want to change, you need to recognize that very trigger. After that, consciously intervene in the process of reproducing the habit and change it to something else. For example, you see a computer and you want to sit down at the computer. At this point, you intervene in the process and consciously start doing something else. The most important thing here is consciousness, to clearly see what made you want to pay attention to it and specifically change the reaction of your body. Repeating this process many times. We quickly rewire our brains to new habits. The more often you consciously apply discipline, the more it manifests itself unconsciously. Too easy\? In fact, everything is really that simple. The more often you show willpower, the stronger willpower becomes. According to scientists, motivation plays a huge role, of course. The more motivated we feel from doing something, the faster and more efficiently the discipline develops, again, according to scientists.\n""\n""This is where the dopamine reboot comes in handy. Now do you understand why consistency is so important\? Until you feel full automatism, you cannot interrupt this process. And it was in order for you to have the strength to see it through to the end, so that you had the motivation and restraint to change the neural network of your brain, that we reversed the dopamine reset and tuned the serotonin system. But despite all this, the process of consciously changing the brain is far from the most pleasant process. What would you compare it to..\? Well, imagine that you have been opening the door to your room with your right hand all your life, and now you have to remember every time that you are forbidden to do it with your right hand, and you must do it with your left hand. How long will it take you to completely forget that you once opened doors with your right hand and accustom yourself to automatism with your left hand. Keep in mind that this door was unusual, and dopamine like sugar. You opened the doors with your right hand and out of habit got a surge of dopamine. And when you open the door with your left hand, you don\'t get the same surge of hormones. The body\'s expectations for the first couples will not be justified. How quickly and easily can you do this task\? For example, how quickly and easily a man gets used to closing the toilet lid. How fast do you learn to brush your teeth with your left hand\? In short, what I am trying to imply is that this is a rather complex process that requires your constant attention and fortitude. But in the end, you will get absolutely automated self-discipline and willpower. It will be easy for you to take on any business. You will be doing more than usual. And in general, the quality of your life will increase significantly. To assist in this process, I would like to recommend a wonderful book by Joe Penza called The Power of the Subconscious or How to Change Your Life in Four Weeks. It gives very well stated theory and powerful techniques. For example, a meditation technique that will change your brain every time you practice it. The book is so good that I will not summarize it, but simply advise everyone to read it on their own. Finally, I will give a great exercise that will allow you to consciously intervene in habits and change them.\n""\n""The average person breathes at about 10 to 15 breaths per minute. Our task is to reduce the number of inhalations and exhalations to six. When you pay attention, you sort of place yourself in the present moment, allowing your mind to focus on the present moment. Once a day for 10 minutes, change the speed of your breathing. Not only will this improve your awareness, but it will also lower your blood pressure and slow your heart rate. This process is somewhat similar to meditation, which I often talk about. That is why it is so effective and is recommended by many scientists to speed up changes in the brain. I will even say more, I advise you to apply this practice during meditation or while walking, so as not to take up extra time. The more aware you are of the moment, the easier it is to manage yourself. By the way, about meditation, I will not stop repeating that it is one of the most powerful tools in general in this whole process. It improves both dopamine and serotonin and speeds up neuroplasticity and makes you more aware. Again, from a scientific point of view. Learn to meditate. Use this practice. Most people underestimate it and miss the most important, powerful opportunity for self-development. In addition to the meditation and mindfulness practices already known to us and useful in a row, there is another thing already mentioned that is also useful for neuroplasticity.\n""\n""Sport. Physical activity accelerates neurogenesis, the central process of neuroplasticity. And here\'s another thing I also talked about, which is intermittent fasting. It turned out that intermittent fasting has another remarkable effect. It also helps neuroplasticity. Short-term fasting triggers the process of neural autophagy. I think that\'s all. But, of course, nutrition also plays a role. For example, neurogenesis requires a large amount of magnesium and a normal balance of omega three, omega six fatty acids, approximately 1:1 or 1:4. So I repeat, for the 100th time nutrition is important. Eat vegetables, fruits and respect your stomach. At this stage, it is enough just to follow the recommendations that I gave above. Go ahead."

    <string name="d8d3">"So, friends, let\'s continue the topic of neuroplasticity. Mindfulness has a special place in this topic. So we will dedicate this lesson to her. In our brain, somewhere very deep behind the skull, there is a muscle of self-discipline. And like any other muscle, it can also be trained. Many studies confirm that self-discipline can be developed with simple training. The methods of training this muscle are very simple, but it is not easy to train them. Often the technique is so simple that you wonder. But the training itself is never easy. Researchers from the University of Chicago conducted an interesting experiment. They took on many couples who were romantically involved. These were people from 18 to 45 years old who had been together for a long time. They were divided into three groups. The first group of people had to brush their teeth with a different hand than usual. If you cleaned with your left, now you had to clean with your right hand. The second group of couples had to stop saying \"Yeah\" and instead say \"Yes\". For us, the equivalent would be to replace the familiar “Uh-huh,” “Yeah,” “Mhm,” with a clearer, “Yes.” That is, they ask you something, and you clearly answer yes or no. And no “No, no” for you and so on. The third group of people received no special instructions. After two weeks, the first two groups were less likely to show aggression towards their partner. They were more attentive, devoted more time to relationships. In the first two couples, there were fewer acts of violence and all that. In the third group, no changes were found. How did it happen that something completely unrelated to the interaction of these people could influence their relationship so much\? This is the muscle of discipline. It\'s very easy to explain. When I talked about meditation, I talked in detail about such a thing as awareness. Mindfulness is the ability to interfere with consciousness, in the usual line of behavior. Well, for example, out of habit, you want to sharply accuse your partner of being wrong. However, consciousness intervenes here. You change emotions and analyze: Yeah, if I\'m not yelling at my partner now, it is unlikely to give a positive result. It would be better for me to say this calmly and just get my point across. In this case, my partner will not get annoyed and get into a protective position. So, we can solve this problem much more effectively. So, when you are forced to turn on consciousness every morning, taking a brush in your left hand or answering “Of course” instead of “Uh-huh”, you charge yourself with consciousness for the whole day. This is what is called getting up on that foot. By the way, why not\? Why not get up, for example, from the right foot. You, as it were, interfere with uncontrolled, emotional, subconscious habits from the very early morning. The same, as you understand, works with self-discipline. Self-discipline is the ability to consciously intervene in unconscious lines of behavior. Instead of sitting on YouTube, you turn your head and look at the situation consciously: Yeah, YouTube is good, but it\'s time to work. Study after study shows that by practicing one small, disciplined, but almost imperceptible thing, we increase self-control in other areas of life. For example, meditation or the practice of brushing your teeth with an unaccustomed hand or preparing for a marathon, all these daily activities strengthen the muscle of self-control. Right now, try to come up with some kind of linguistic task. Say, don\'t say the word \"shorter\" or any other word parasite. Or, for example, really take the brush in your left hand or finally start closing the toilet lid or something like that. Come up with something unusual for you, but let it be something that you encounter on a daily basis on an ongoing basis. For example, here\'s what I did. I have always liked to wobble my foot when I was sitting in a chair. I had to control myself. It was difficult, like any act of awareness, but it paid off. In general, the more you practice mindfulness in your life, the better. Relatively speaking, before scratching the back of your head, you should think: is the back of my head itching, or am I doing it out of habit\? Do you understand what I mean\? But the most powerful, in my opinion, is all the same linguistics. We are constantly saying something. Practice in your own language. it will improve your self-discipline. Now it has been scientifically proven."

    <string name="d8d4">"We love to put things off until tomorrow. And it all starts with the wrong question. Yes, sometimes the question is not asked at all, but with the help of meditation or linguistic exercises and other things that we discussed above, you will pay attention to unconscious motives more often, which means you will be able to insert your conscious questions there. And the more you train like this, the better your brain plasticity will work, automatically developing your self-discipline. The problem is that it\'s one thing to train yourself to pay attention to your behavior and ask yourself questions. However, it is quite another thing to ask yourself the right questions and draw the right conclusions. We almost always think wrong. Our brain, in order to maintain the status quo, will fight to the end. He does not want to waste energy, he does not want to drain his own resources, so he will resort to the dirtiest manipulations to avoid self-discipline. One such manipulation is clumsy questions. Agree, there is a difference between do I want a cake and do I want all the consequences that come with this cake\? You\'ve probably already felt the difference\! A correctly posed question is also called common sense or a complete picture of the world. Manipulation always uses only a piece of information. For example, what is a deal with the devil\? It\'s when a man sells his soul, and it sounds pretty innocent. However, he is not told how and for what this soul will be used, how he will participate in all this. He is told nothing but two things. Your wish will come true, your soul will be sold and that\'s it. At the same time, they do not say that after the wish comes true, you will lose all will to live. You will not be happy that the wish came true. All this is left out of brackets. It\'s like signing a contract without reading what\'s in it in small letters. This is how our mind behaves in the same way. It reports selective information, it reads out only half of the slander.\n""And until you ask yourself, the second half of the agreement is hushed up. Our task is to train ourselves to ask ourselves the right questions with the help of awareness and neuroplasticity. Here is an example with a cake: I am sure that you would very quickly quit eating sweets if a voice sounded inside before a meal: what a delicious cake you will eat now and get unreal pleasure. True, it will last only 10 seconds. As a result of this, your receptors on the tongue will clog. And next time you\'ll want something sweeter. Also from this piece of cake you remove your own chances of success in life, and also increase the chances of getting diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and all that. Oh yes, this 10 second pleasure will also give you pimples on your face and terrible skin that you try to smear with expensive creams, spending a lot of money. But nothing, money is not a problem for you, get used to it. This cake is unlikely to benefit you, and in the future you will pay hundreds of times more, sitting in clinics, because you cannot afford a doctor, unlike those who work on themselves and deny themselves a cake.\n""\n""This is how your consciousness should have sounded, if it were honest. But no, this will not happen until it is trained to the level of a watchdog, it will only divulge part of the information. For the first pairs, you will have to dig into your own mind, and this is not an easy task. But the principle here is very simple. Always put the question squarely: Do I want to save until the end of my life until tomorrow\? Do I want to stop eating cake just after a heart attack\? Do I need the consequences that come with this decision\? Am I ready to take responsibility for my action or inaction\? and so on. Howard Rachlin, in his studies of human behavior, clearly proved the effectiveness of this technique for the development of self-discipline. I recommend reading his book The Science of Self-Control. Friends, I repeat once again, the right question is half the success. The deeper the question, the less chance of wrong actions. Understand that the consequences of every action are truly massive. There is no such thing as personal choice. We are now making decisions on a universal scale every day, every hour, every minute. The universe is a closed system, and within a closed system, each element influences all other elements. If you have ever looked at anything under a microscope, you have seen that everything is always in motion. Nothing stands still. For example, water. The atoms inside the water run like crazy. They are constantly bumping into each other. There is constant movement. And the same thing happens in our world. Every action you take affects every aspect of the system. What choice you make today means a lot to your children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Tritely, by starting to do something, you will probably ensure a rich life for your descendants, you will ensure the survival of your genes, that is, you will continue yourself in the future. By simply reading books instead of watching stupid videos, you accumulate wisdom that you can pass on for several generations to come. And after 1000 generations, this wisdom will be reflected in 1,000,000%. Not a single action passes without consequences for yourself, your environment, your close colleagues, your future, the future of your children, grandchildren, their grandchildren, the country in which you live, the world and the universe. Everything is interconnected. And when you decide whether to eat brownie, you are making a decision that will change the universe. This decision will have real tangible consequences tomorrow. And the more deeply you look at each of your actions, the better you understand: No, I won’t eat cake. No, I won\'t put it off until tomorrow. No, I will not neglect this opportunity and so on. The right question solves almost everything."
</string>
    <string name="d8d5">"So, let\'s sum up a little on the issue of neuroplasticity. In fact, we need it in order to establish a new automatic line of behavior. Neuroplasticity is needed to reflash old automatic lines of behavior with new ones. You used to wake up in a bad mood, and then with the help of neuroplasticity you changed your default state. Joy is what, by default, you will basically experience in the morning. If you go back to your childhood, you will find that you did not have the habits that you suffer from now. They appeared over a long period of time, the way you think, what you pay attention to, how you feel, and so on. It\'s all just a habit, electronic connections in your brain. And neuroplasticity helps to make changes for the better, or rather, in the direction you need\!\n""\n""So, we need to start rewriting neural connections, for which we have already considered quite a lot of tools. But now I would like to dwell on awareness in more detail, since this is a very important topic. And its power in terms of forming a line of behavior is beyond all bounds. To understand how mindfulness works, let\'s look at an example. All of you can imagine an elephant. Now imagine an elephant walking on the floor. What do you think will happen\? Will it break the parquet\? No, it will not break, despite its huge weight. This is because the area of \u200B\u200B\u200B\u200Bcontact, his body and parquet is very wide. He has big feet. Now imagine a woman in pointy heels. Will she leave marks on the floor\? Yes, they will, because the area of \u200B\u200Bapplication of force is 1000 times smaller than that of an elephant. Thus, we see that no matter how much power and resources you have, if you are not able to concentrate them in one point, you are unlikely to be able to create meaningful change. So, the key point is the area of \u200B\u200Bapplication of force, where we apply our forces. Here I am walking down the street, I smell, I see the trees around me and I am aware of my body. Although, wait. Besides that, I\'m still thinking about what happened yesterday, how I can prepare for what will happen tomorrow. I regret that I didn’t have time for something and I am making plans on how I can do it in the future. At the same time, I mentally train in the gym and exchanged glances with the girl who showed signs of attention. Imagine what I\'ll say the next time I see her, Right there, I\'m thinking about what I should eat for dinner. I also analyze world politics through the prism of holy scriptures, when I still look at the road and try not to go astray. And I also have headphones in my ears, and I listen to my favorite song. So what do I end up doing\? Because at the same time I do a whole bunch of things. This is also called multitasking. You certainly don\'t think it\'s multitasking. But take a closer look, you really are in a state of multipartyism, and no, this is not good. For example, according to a 2014 study, multitasking leads to a decrease in gray matter in the brain, which significantly reduces mental control, motivation, and the desire to live in general. But a 2016 study shows that multitasking, or more specifically multitasking associated with media consumption, causes memory loss. It also causes mild distractibility syndrome. Among other things, it causes chronic stress and depression. In short, multitasking is bad. No matter what type of multitasking. Do you try to eat while watching a movie or think about high while sitting on the toilet. Everything has its time. Multitasking is like an elephant\'s leg. She steps on the parquet and nothing happens, despite the fact that the weight of the elephant is huge. But if you only focus your attention on one thing, then you become 1,000,000 times more efficient. When you walk, you truly experience the experience that you are experiencing. You feel your body, smell the acacia blossoms, look at the blue sky, hear the birds singing and feel the wind blow. If you completely immerse yourself in these sensations, you may even burst into tears from an excess of feelings. Why\? Because you managed to concentrate the experience gained. You gave him enough attention. This is awareness. We usually live on autopilot and don\'t take the experience for what it is. Mixing it with something else. Therefore, we never really think deeply, we don’t walk, we don’t communicate and we don’t eat. The taste of food does not seem great to us, simply because we do not follow the taste of food, although this is what nature requires of us - to have a comprehensive experience.\n""\n""So, when we focus on our experience, we show respect for the world and for ourselves. But, among other things, we greatly increase our ability to self-control, and also accelerate the rewiring of the brain. Our consciousness becomes plastic. We stop living on the machine and finally start doing something for real. Why am I saying all this\? To the fact that awareness accelerates the process of self-discipline. Mindfulness makes you a person who is able to manage your life. The central process in meditation is awareness. When you follow your thought, you follow the processes that take place in your head. This is awareness. That is why meditation is effective for self-control. And if we know that small 10 minutes a day of meditation speeds up the process of self-control several times, then you can imagine what will happen to you if you fully feel your whole life, living meditation every second. I often give the example of the Chinese tea ceremony. Many people think that this is some kind of stupid ritual. But look closer. This is a ritual of awareness. Every movement is perfected. Every drop of tea is observed, every sip is monitored. It starts processes in you that modern scientists are discovering only now. The same can be said about the Japanese writing of hieroglyphs. For most, this will forever remain a mystery. Why draw a hieroglyph\? The challenge is to draw it perfectly. That is, to be present in every single moment of writing this hieroglyph. And with each new leaf, with each new hieroglyphs, you are getting closer to the present moment. There is no past, no future. There is only the present moment, having perceived that one becomes enlightened. But we do not seek enlightenment. We only need to start the process of awareness, which plays a central role in the formation of discipline. Launching it is very easy. We have already discussed a couple of ways in previous lessons, for example, brushing your teeth with a different hand than usual. Get up on the right foot and so on. It\'s great that you don\'t waste time on these things. For example, meditation requires you to take the time to sit down and watch your thoughts. But meditation in action does not require extra time. Start with breakfast, for example. Try eating breakfast a little differently. Pay attention to your first meal. For example, put everything in its place. Do everything carefully. Prepare cutlery, pour a drink, sit down on a chair. Look at everything on the table. Grab your utensils and start tasting the food very carefully. Try to feel every bite. Feel the texture, taste, smell, immerse yourself in the sensation of food. Do not think about what was and what will be. Do not watch TV or YouTube, this important information will not run away from you anywhere. Make time for yourself. This is called concentrated experience, when you accelerate your own evolution. When you feel each desire that arises in you, you know the source of each desire. It is not difficult for you to trace why you suddenly wanted a candy. It is not difficult for you to understand where the desire to fall on the sofa and do nothing comes from.\n""You see all this very clearly and it becomes easier for you to control yourself. Try not to mix things up. When you walk, walk. When you eat - eat, and when you work - work. And so on. For example, there is a poster hanging at the exit of my room. \"When I do, I do.\" And every time I pass him, I remember that I have to be aware of my movements on the way to the kitchen, pouring a glass of water. I do it carefully and carefully. And drinking this glass, I feel every sip. It doesn\'t take any time. It\'s just part of my daily routine. I just eat or drink water like everyone else, but I am in constant meditation. And this, without exaggeration, will make you a superman. And do not worry that you will not have time to think about some pressing matters. You can also set aside time for this. Surprisingly, the same rule applies to thinking. If you think - think. Sit down, close your eyes and think about the question that interests you. If you feel bad, take a walk. Only for real. Then sit down again and think again. It will be a concentrated meditation. Not diluted with external debris. Nothing will distract you. And the answer will come much faster and better.\n""\n""So awareness. Mindfulness triggers neurogenesis, the central process of forming new habits and behaviors. This is what will make you a completely different person. You live on the machine. This is how you get involved in the process. Rewrite your habits."

    <string name="d8d6">"In this lesson, we will finish the topic of neuroplasticity and habit formation. I will describe a cycle by which each of you can adjust your daily life in such a way that it matches your ideal. According to researchers at the University of California, lack of self-control and willpower does not mean that your life will sink to the bottom. What really matters is what you are used to, what your brain is used to. That\'s what\'s important. Well, conditionally, when you have no motivation, and you don’t want to force yourself to do anything, then you do what your body is used to. How would you operate an automatic. If you are used to watching TV, you will watch TV. If you are used to reading books and working, then you will read books and work. The task of neuroplasticity is to accustom your body at the level of a habit to do what will be useful. Thus, discipline is needed only to form good habits. Willpower, self-discipline and self-control are needed only when you want to make a breakthrough, and the rest of the time you act on the machine. I have been talking about this for all the time of training, but I decided to repeat it again. That is why in this training, I am not only talking about how to develop willpower, self-discipline and awareness through meditation, reset and tuning the dopamine system. But I also talk about how to form habits with the help of neuroplasticity. These are two parts of the same process.\n""\n""So how do you form habits\? Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have discovered the simplest cycle that is at the heart of any habit. Hook (trigger) - actions - reward. I have already talked in detail about how the reward system works in the part about dopamine. And I think you understand how to use the reward to your advantage. But let\'s talk about leads. It all starts with a hook. A hook is what starts a habit. Well, for example, you open the door to your room, you see a computer in front of you, and you have a desire to sit down at the computer. This is a hook. Opening the door to your room is a CLUE by which your consciousness understands: Aha, now I\'m going to sit at the computer. You sit down at the computer, turn on the game and play - this is ACTION. Next, you win the game, and this is the REWARD. By winning the game, you have received a reward and neural connections are even more firmly entrenched. You have made the habit stronger. Absolutely all habits, both good and bad, are built on this principle. First the hook in the external or internal state, then the actions, then the reward. No habit goes beyond this cycle. So if everything starts with hooks, how do you use them\? After all, it is the hooks that trigger a certain habit. First, the leads are different. You can rely on the place, time, emotional state, the people around you and the actions that you do or that take place in the world around you. You can form a habit based on any of these points. For example, I meditate in my room at 7 am. Time and place 7am and my room is a HOOK. Meditation itself is an ACTION, the feeling of calmness that arises after meditation is a real REWARD for me. Thus, I formed the habit of meditating when I go into my room and see 7 o\'clock on the clock. After I take a cold shower, I immediately start meditating and my body craves it because it knows that after doing the meditation, I will be rewarded with a very pleasant calm feeling in my body and mind. I\'ll give you another example. I once programmed my mind that if I feel bad, for example, if I\'m angry, if I\'m not calm, or I\'m just in a bad mood, then I do 20 push-ups, 20 squats and 20 pull-ups. My bad emotional state is a CLUE. That is, whenever I experience a bad emotional state, I start the habit of doing this exercise. That is, I do push-ups, squats and pull-ups, because the habit has started. And after the exercise, I usually calm down, and my mood improves. That is, it is a PRIZE. Again, the same three cycles of hook - action - reward. Another example. If I walk, I turn on awareness. Walking is a HITCH. Mindfulness is an ACTION and at the same time a REWARD, because the very feeling of awareness is very pleasant. Another example, if I am surrounded by unpleasant people, then I am calm and unperturbed, despite their provocations. The nasty people around me and the things they say is a CLUE. My state is ACTION. That is, I am calm, peace is balanced. It is ACTION. And the fact that I behave with dignity and cause respect, I feel this as a REWARD. Again, the same three cycles. Bad people are a clue. My state is the action and respect that I evoke, this is the reward and so on. Every situation can become a hook. So if you want to get into a habit, you need to create the right hooks and get rid of the wrong ones. Pay attention, each of your bad habits has some kind of hook. You start doing something for a reason. This happens as a result of the action on you, some kind of stimulus, internal or external. Well, let\'s try to form some habits to understand how it works. Let\'s go through two steps.\n""\n""Step one. We ask the right questions.\n""What habit do I want to introduce into my life so that it is constant, automated, daily and stable\? For example, I want to start meditating.\n""When should this habit occur\? At 7 o\'clock in the morning.\n""Where and under what circumstances should this habit take place\? It should take place in my room after I have taken a cold shower.\n""What environmental cues might remind me to do this habit\? It\'s like this for me: When I go into the room in a semi-frozen state and it\'s morning, I know that it\'s time for me to meditate.\n""How can I use the environment to better instill a habit\? This is how it is for me: Before I take a cold shower, I will leave the chair on which I meditate in the center of the room so that when I enter the room I know exactly what I need to do.\n""\n""Step two is habit specificity. Start simple and small. When you change your life, start with small specific habits. Scientists believe that specific planning is the best way to form healthy habits. We have already partly talked about this. But I remind you that the more precisely you specify the time, place and other clues, the better the habit will take root. You can’t give your brain the opportunity to choose, otherwise it will always choose the easy option. I\'ll give you an example. Every time I enter the kitchen, I drink 100 milliliters of water. After a while, when you enter the kitchen, you will automatically drink 100 liters of water, and you will even want to drink those 100 liters of water, regardless of tension or lack of tension. This habit will become automatic. You can do the same with any other action. But you need to start with small, simple, specific actions. They are very easy to train on. So, during this training, I have given you a lot of things to bring into your life in order to have perfect self-discipline. Start introducing them gradually and associate each habit with some kind of hook and reward. After the dopamine reset, as I said, there will be no problems with the reward. A simple walk will be your reward. Achieving the goal will already be your reward. Here are some clues you can make up yourself. Program the environment. Gradually make a complete rearrangement in your room, for example, so that each item evokes associations only with useful deeds. This may sound complicated, but it really only seems like it. You can fundamentally change your life in a couple of months, especially if your serotonin and dopamine systems are tuned. It will be very easy to introduce new habits, relying on the clues of the world around you and the reward. Using hooks, you reprogram your brain in a new way. Everything in the surrounding space will arouse in you the desire to do something useful, and the body will rejoice at this and will get to work with great pleasure. The main thing is not to rush. The main thing is to do it gradually. No need to dump a whole bunch of ready-made habits on yourself. Everything I have said in this tutorial should be done gradually. First, nutrition, then meditation, then some exercises, then walks in nature, then an early rise, then something else. And in a few months, you literally won\'t know your life. The main thing is to strike a balance between stress and reward that the body receives. Neuroplasticity works under stress. But the stress should be small. Just the right amount to change your behavior, but not so powerful that you can hardly walk. Reflash your brain. It\'s very simple."

    <string name="d9d1">"So, we are done with more or less science block. Now we will begin to slowly collect all this into a working system. Along the way, clarifying many important points. So, dopamine, serotonin and neuroplasticity. By this lesson, you should already have mastered the principles of their work and optimization.\n""\n""And now let\'s continue. As we have seen, the ability to delay gratification is the master skill of self-discipline. In other words, the easier it is for you to put off the buzz for later, the easier it is for you to self-discipline. And many scientists are trying to find out what helps a person develop this quality in himself. For example, in 2014, researchers at the University of Toronto published their findings. For us, I think they will be very interesting.\n""\n""Pillar one. Improve self-control by setting more specific, self-focused goals. The first step in restoring and improving self-control is goals. There is a big difference between a goal and a desire. Desire sounds like this: I want to lose weight. When you set a goal, you engage thought, emotion, and behavior. Setting a goal means: to clearly separate the state in which you are now with the state in which you want to get. Locke and Atom\'s goal-setting theory, which they compiled over 35 years of 1,000 experiments per 1,000,000 people, says that if we simply set a specific, difficult, but achievable goal, it leads us to much better self-control. And if we set a vague goal or if there is no goal at all, then self-control, according to research, is significantly reduced. If there is no incentive, then you can drive yourself into a complete lack of motivation to do anything. For example, to make it easier to follow a diet, you need to set yourself a specific goal. For example, eat salad three times a week for lunch. Most people set other goals for themselves.\n""For example, they say: I will try to eat right. Feel the difference\? We have already talked about variability. This is where it shows up. Your goals should leave you no choice. Choice comes from poor planning. Bad planning is when there is an ultimate goal, and the plan to achieve this goal is, as it were, not voiced. After all, it’s kind of clear that: “To eat well, you need to eat salad. I’m not a fool, talk about elementary things.”\n""\n""It is precisely the elementary things that are of the most decisive importance. The elementary things are good planning. And good planning is the key to self-discipline. I\'ll give you another example. You say: this year I will be an excellent student. The brain sort of looks at this goal and thinks: OK, he was going to be an excellent student. Okay, I\'m ready to be an excellent student. And now I want to sleep.\n""\n""The brain should not have any variation. Step to the left, step to the right - execution. Therefore, the goal should sound differently: Every day I go to school. Every evening from 19:00 to 21:00 I turn off all social networks and sit down for my homework. If there is suddenly no homework, then I still sit down and repeat the material already studied. This is the specific goal of an adult. Setting goals with clear time frames greatly improves performance. I\'ll explain why. If you have a specific plan for each day, then this allows you to easily track whether your behavior is consistent with your plan. If there are no specific goals, then tracking progress is unrealistic. After all, theoretically, you can prepare for the session the night before the exams, right\? The brain, as it were, will not worry about the lost day, because there are still a hundred of the same days ahead. But if you have a deadline every day, this is where your brain starts to work in a completely different way. This is called feedback. So, the first indicator of a good goal is the specificity of both the wording and the timing. However, that\'s not all. Not all specific goals work equally well. Goals aligned with personal values \u200B\u200Blead to greater self-control. In other words, the quality of motivation matters more than the quantity of motivation. When goals come from within, it is easier to control behavior, even in moments of complete apathy. In other words, if you enjoy programming, but you force yourself to sell in a store, then controlling yourself is a hundred times more difficult. Even if every day you have a scheduled on the shelves, set clear goals, and even if you are very well paid for it, one day you will slide into complete apathy.\n""\n""So, the second component of a good goal is intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is when you are rushing from what you are doing. External motivation is when you are rewarded for what you do. In this sense, salary is an extrinsic motivation. So running after money is always less effective than doing something for personal satisfaction. The scientists also clarifies that in order to avoid failures in self-discipline, you need to remind yourself why you are doing it. But I have already talked about this in previous lessons. So let\'s sum it up. Self-discipline goes hand in hand with goals. Goals should be clear, specific and timed. For example: I set myself a goal. Once a week on Wednesday at 18:00 I go to the local pool and swim in it for exactly one hour. In addition, goals should inspire, so each individual goal should be endowed with a deep meaning that is important to you personally. For example, while swimming in the pool, she needs to motivate herself with health. If health doesn\'t motivate you, motivate yourself with looks that you can achieve. Imagine yourself in all its glory and swim for this. Similarly, you don\'t need to motivate yourself with good grades in school. Motivate yourself with future prospects if that inspires you. If neither future prospects nor grades inspire you, find something of your own and always remind yourself of it. Everyone has something of their own. Find it and put this meaning into every action you take. Then those will be good goals.\n""\n""Pillar two. Improving self-control through tracking. After you have set yourself deep, specific goals that match your essence. The next step is to track how your behavior is in line with your goals. You kind of look at yourself from the outside and analyze your own behavior, how adequate it is to the future that you want. More specifically, you should pay attention to those moments when you failed to achieve some goal. Paying attention to such defeats helps you avoid future mistakes. For example, if you are trying to quit smoking, then you need to pay attention to situations in which you are more likely to smoke. For example, if you go for a walk with a smoker. When you recognize that your behavior is in conflict with your goal of quitting smoking, it is easier for you to stop smoking. Scientists have proven time and time again that simply analyzing the situations in which you gave in to temptation improves future cognitive control. The part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex is responsible for this. It allows us to track errors related to our behavior. By the way, the dopamine system is also responsible for this. When you think about a situation in which a mistake has occurred, it causes an instant neural exchange in the brain that recognizes the conflict of consciousness, as a result of which new alternative lines of behavior are automatically built through neuroplasticity. Those of us who do not try to forget about our mistakes, but analyze them, eventually become the most disciplined. And this is a scientific fact. So introspection is the power to track the conflict of behavior and goals. A great tool is mindfulness meditation, which I will talk about until I\'m blue in the face until you understand how deep and versatile this process is. It involves simply paying attention to the present moment. The ability to consciously look at the current moment improves self-control, including the ability to resist weaknesses and other momentary pleasures.\n""\n""Pillar Three: Improving self-control through acceptance. You probably thought that introspection is an unpleasant thing that has to do with observation and feeling inner shame. On the contrary, however, self-control improves when people recognize and accept the mistakes they have made. Perhaps this happens because when you accept a mistake you made, you can return to your goal and not focus on the negative. It is this approach that allows us to avoid such mistakes in the future. By acceptance, I mean an open and non-judgmental vision of the error. If you try to excuse yourself and how to justify yourself, your consciousness will not learn from mistakes. It is the acceptance of the mistake made that is without which introspection does not work. Let\'s say you ate a cake. It is necessary, firstly, to clearly analyze why this happened, and secondly, to accept what happened as a fact without a sense of shame. The effectiveness of adoption is confirmed by many studies that I have already shown. But here\'s one more thing. For example, a former smoker suddenly smokes a cigarette for some reason. If he realizes the cause of this event and accepts the event itself, then he, unlike others, will not return to addiction. Therefore, the less shame, shame, and grief you feel, the easier it will be for you not to make similar mistakes in the future.\n""\n""Pillar four. Improving self-control through intentions. Another great way is to think ahead about how you will behave in different situations. You determine where, when, how and what you will do. For example, you think: when I see a cake, I will just drink a glass of water. And imagine it. There is a cake in front of you. And you look at him indifferently. Then take a glass of water and drink. In this way, you are programming yourself for a certain behavior, which is a scientific fact. The effectiveness of this approach has been proven in many studies. For example, in a study on children, which found that children who practice a specific intention are better at completing tasks. You must have heard the myth of Odysseus. He wanted to hear the sirens sing. But usually all the sailors, as soon as they heard the singing of the sirens, directed the ship not to the rocks and died. What did he come up with\? He tied himself to the mast, and covered the ears of his companions with wax, ordering them not to change course at all costs. Thus, he enjoyed the singing of the sirens and survived. This is a great example of how you should program yourself to do or not to do. You need to know in advance what temptations are waiting for you and where, programming yourself and your environment to make the right choice.\n""\n""Summarize. Although we have painted all four mechanisms separately, it is very easy to tie them into one monolithic process, which I personally repeat every day. It will take you very little time. You set goals, reflect on your behavior, then analyze what has already been done and what mistakes have been made. Personally, I spend the so-called morning and evening rituals. You will learn how to do this in the next lesson."
</string>
    <string name="d9d2">"So, in the last lesson, we looked at the four pillars on which the process of discipline formation is based. First, we set goals, then we tracked how our behavior coincides with these same goals. Then we accept our mistakes and, finally, use intentions in order not to make these same mistakes next time. As I said, these four points can be combined into a single monolithic process, which I call a ritual. Personally, I have two rituals. Morning and evening. It\'s like brushing your teeth. They must be present in my every day in the morning after waking up and every evening before going to bed. After waking up and washing my face, I drink a glass of water, and then sit down in an armchair, take a notebook and write down the date. Then very well for five minutes I think: why did I wake up today\? Each day should begin with a comparison of large-scale goals, with specific daily actions. I am trying to realize how every step I take today will bring me closer to my goal, to the great task that I set for myself, how I develop myself, how I develop my family, how I develop society, how I develop the earth, how I developing space. All these questions run through my head, and I tune in to them, and then write down the conclusion: Today I woke up to .... And I try with all my heart to feel what I am writing down. My task is to emotionally delve into the goals that I set, but at the same time make them as clear and not variable as possible. Well, for example, my goal is to score win a design competition. I set myself a daily challenge. Today I will write a text, or today I will make a presentation, or today I will research non-fiction. So I have one very small, clear task that I know when I will be doing it. For example, at 2:00 pm, I specifically know what this action is for. To win the competition. This, of course, also has a deeper meaning, one might say, universal. And I\'m juxtaposing all these different levels into one very big, serious, monolithic understanding, which is reinforced by emotions. This is followed by the second block of my morning ritual. It\'s called gratitude. This, I consider, is one of the most important moments of my morning ritual. It is he who fills me with confidence for the day. I remember everything that I have, all the blessings, all the joys of all those close to me, all my achievements, all the successes, all the prospects. And basically anything that makes me happy. And then I thank the world around for this: If not for the world, I simply would not be able to experience this. And it\'s hard for me to explain exactly how it works. Maybe it sounds like some kind of nonsense, but when you truly thank God, nature or any force you want to believe in, even if it is quantum physics, the laws of the universe do not matter. If you truly believe that the world is helping you on your path, it will give you strength. Gratitude is the best feeling. Gratitude is what makes you stronger. You can be grateful for almost everything, for the taste of freshly squeezed juice, for the fact that a bird sings outside the window, for success in business, for the difficulties that you were able to overcome, for the difficulties that await you. You can be grateful for everything. The only condition: you need to believe in it, and only then it will make you stronger. I write down five thanks and thank all the forces that help me, whether it be people, nature, the laws of the universe, and whatever. Anything that comes to my mind. The main thing is to fill yourself with calm gratitude, to enlist the support of some forces. I know that perhaps not everyone will be able to accept this idea, but I advise you to start your morning with gratitude for what you have anyway.\n""\n""Then, after the whole day has passed, I begin the evening ritual. The evening ritual is even more important. Shortly before bed, I pick up my notebook again and ask myself the following questions: First, what lessons did I learn during the day\? Every day brings us some lessons. Maybe I got into an argument with someone I know. Maybe I overslept in the morning. Perhaps there were some problems.\n""\n""What happened today that you should pay attention to\? What moments touched me\? What was the world trying to tell me\? This is exactly what conflict tracking is. I begin to compare what of today from my actions did not correspond to my highest goals. Why did these actions take place in my life and how did I allow them into my life\?\n""\n""And finally, what conclusions can be drawn from this\? And also how to prevent them in your life next time\? What can I do better\? What changes in my behavior should I make\? How can I change\? How to optimize your actions\?\n""\n""Be less irritable. Be sensitive to the weaknesses of those around you. Go to bed earlier. Reduce the amount of time on social networks by half an hour. What else should I do\?\n""At the same time, I do not blame myself for my jambs and do not feel guilty. My main task is to detect a system failure in the system and fix it. And finally, after filling out the diary, based on conscious mistakes, I sit down in meditation and create an intention that I will put into action in the future. Let\'s illustrate how this all happens. Let\'s say I woke up in the morning and one of the goals that I set for myself during the morning ritual was, let\'s say: reduce the amount of sugar eaten by two more spoons. But during the day, for some reason, I did not complete this task and ate as much sugar as usual. In the evening, during the ritual, I sit down and begin to analyze how it happened. As a result, it turned out that when I came to visit a friend, she made me tea and, without asking, added sugar. I decided not to pay attention to it, so as not to offend her. And he just drank tea, and even with a sweet roll. This behavior is contrary to my goal of cutting out sugar. The conclusion is made. The situation is analyzed and I begin to create intentions. I imagine: the next time someone offers me tea with sugar, I will just politely refuse, despite the fact that the hosts may be unpleasant. I present this situation from different angles, in different colors and under different circumstances, in order to clearly fix my future reaction.\n""This is how I spend mine every morning and evening without exception. If there is no paper in front of me, I redo it all in my mind. But when I have the opportunity to write, I write. It seems to me that everything is so much better absorbed. I am not exaggerating when I say that this is one of the most effective habits in my life. Morning sets up, evening sums up, and intentions program new behavior. And so every day. Thus, I know exactly what I wanted and what I achieved. And I can easily track my progress. It\'s not hard for me to get better and better every day. Many may think that this is all very long. But no. The morning ritual takes me 10 minutes, and the evening ritual takes about 20. As a result, about 30 minutes a day. In my opinion, this is much more useful than sitting on some social networks or doing some other nonsense. My rituals make the most of the four pillars of change that I covered in the last lesson. I set clear, daily, deep goals that correspond to my essence, track how they were achieved, analyze failures and model my behavior. Start and you introduce yourself morning and evening rituals. Ask yourself questions. They don\'t have to be like mine. Pick the ones you need. We are all unique. And it\'s not a good idea to copy the work of others. My system of rituals is only my preparation. You can come up with something personal, but be sure to start small."

    <string name="d10d1">"What is perfect self-discipline\? This is when everything that you can control: automatically, without effort, develops as you need. This does not mean that every day you do the same thing. And this does not mean that you overpower yourself. Self-discipline is when you are so merged with your ideal - I, as far as possible. You do everything to be better, and this does not complicate your life, but on the contrary, it simplifies it. This is what a perfect day is. After all, self-discipline, in fact, comes down to a perfectly spent day. That\'s right, if you effectively completed all the things that you planned with joy. This, in my opinion, is the perfect day. But you know when a person succeeds and can live a perfect day\? When he is completely immersed in his every business. Well, here, during a workout, you concentrate on the muscles, breathing, sensations in the body, and at this moment you are progressing the most. We\'ve talked about this before, but let\'s do it again. How do most train\? They listen to music, talk about business, look at the beauty who is sitting at the other end of the hall and try to lift the weight, which is twice as much as necessary. This kind of training is no good. You don’t train at all, but you do a whole bunch of things at once and listen and talk and think and try to squeeze the exercise out of yourself. It\'s the same in life. Any business that we do can only be effective when we are fully focused on it. Training is concentration on the work of the body. Learning is the concentration on obtaining new knowledge. Nutrition is concentration on the taste of food and so on. But how to achieve such a state of constant concentration\? In every business there is one principle - value your time.\n""\n""Yes, everything is so simple. Appreciate your time, because it can end at any moment. Yes, life can end at any moment. You can go into oblivion. Very soon your body will decay, and nothing will remain of your things. Only the little moment that you have lived will matter. How did you live it\? what information and what experience did you pass on to the future\? What trace did you leave in the history of mankind\? If every day is the last, then there is an irresistible desire to spend it perfectly. Make sure that your every action corresponds to your highest earthly destiny. Do you want to oversleep on your last day\? Will you quarrel with people over trifles\? Or will you be the most efficient\? Perhaps you will become so collected, disciplined and accurate that any machine will envy. In fact, we tend to act like we have plenty of time. We allow doubts, fears, unnecessary deliberations, and it seems to have entered into our nature to believe that we can afford this luxury, that we have time for something other than the perfect action. A real person is ready to die at any moment, so he acts as efficiently as possible. He does not allow anything in his action except the action itself. After all, dying in doubt is the worst thing that can be. This does not mean that doubt is evil. Doubt is a great tool for self-development. But doubt must also have its time. Like meditation, like jogging, like work. But you don\'t have to mix everything together. No need to try to eat, at the same time think about your career, doubting your actions and at the same time trying to print something to your girlfriend on social networks. Everything has its time. If you are doing something, give yourself completely to your work. Memento Mori. Only in this way will you achieve perfect self-discipline. The principle of death does not untie your hands. It makes you the most efficient version of yourself. If you write, write, don\'t eat a sandwich. If you play sports, do sports, and do not engage in conversations with a partner. If you read - read, not thinking about your relationship. For at any next moment you may not be. Only by being in each individual case to the end, you can complete it perfectly. And only when we carry out every task perfectly, when we fill every part of ourselves with what we are doing. Only then can we live a decent life. And such a life is a life of discipline and attention to oneself. In fact, discipline is just an indicator. How much do you love yourself\! This is a direct indicator of self-esteem. If you decide to do something or not to do something, it is your choice, your decision. How can you expect others to respect your choices and decisions if you don\'t respect them yourself\? Many people talk about politics like this: look, we are not respected, the people are getting poorer, everything is bad. And why, in fact, you need to be respected if you don’t even respect yourself\? If your own decision means nothing, you don\'t love yourself, why should others love you\? If I see a girl who is true to herself, then I can count on loyalty to me. I don\'t even need her promises or assurances. I can definitely see from her behavioral factors that she is true to her own promises. But if in front of me is a girl who yesterday vowed not to eat junk food, and today she crushes cheesecake, then I obviously cannot be trusted in a relationship. She is not true to herself. Harsh, but true. If she cannot even follow her own values, how can she follow common values, family values, for example\? In other words, constancy is the first indicator of a strong, harmonious personality. I would even say more, this is one of the main indicators of a stable person, a person who can be relied upon, whose words can be trusted. An excellent indicator of self-esteem, as I said, is the ability to manage oneself - discipline. When I think about discipline and self-respect, I always think about death. These three things go hand in hand inextricably. A beautiful death is when a Japanese samurai master dies in battle during the triumph of his skill, when every movement of his sword is perfection. Or death during the Chinese tea ceremony we talked about earlier, when every second counts. Or the death of a Caucasian yogi on the top of a mountain who has known enlightenment. Or the death of a singer at a concert in front of a crowd of thousands, into which he is so invested with his voice that the nerve forces cannot stand it, and his body dies. Overwhelmed with feelings, your heart broke. Or an old man, sitting in front of the fireplace, himself invites death and meets it with embraces, because the time has come, and he understands this. In a word, the ideal death is when you are fully aware of what is happening. It happens during some ideally performed case. Majestic death occurs during something majestic, when you are filled with consciousness, when your whole body and mind are directed to one place. This is the perfect time to die.\n""\n""And the fact is that death can come at any moment. I would not want to die thinking about how the state has me. I wouldn\'t want to die with a bag of chips in my hand or watching porn. This death is not for me. And since it can come at any moment, discipline and self-control is my life credo. And it seems to me that most people think that they are immortal until they die. No one considers each next moment as potentially the last, because then you would have to invest your whole self in the moment that is now coming. Does anyone want to commit meanness at the time of death\? Who wants to die doing what they swore never to do\? What could be worse than such a death\? I don\'t know how people feel. There are a lot of my reflections in this training, but, in my opinion, the strength lies in appreciating every single moment. And death in this sense is a good helper. Recently I was asked how I enjoy just walking alone in the middle of the city. How can you get away with it at all\? Well, besides the fact that my serotonin and dopamine systems are tuned, I look at the world as if for the last time and I see 1,000,000 times more than other people. Eyes greedily cling to everything beautiful. It cannot be described, it can only be felt. Nothing else can teach you to love your daily life as much as the principle of death. I guess I\'ve said everything. Think about it. And it\'s not like it\'s a fairy tale. No, you understand that this is a real MATHEMATICAL, probable possibility that in the next moment you will not be."
</string>
    <string name="d10d2">"Now one of the most important topics of this training will be our environment. I think it\'s no secret to anyone who is at least a little interested in self-development that the environment is very important. But you know what I face from time to time. People understand everything, but do nothing. Everyone knows that the negative environment destroys us. Everyone knows that loser friends drag us down. Everyone knows that successful people around us make us more successful. But for some reason no one follows these ideals. Some, of course, think that they are able to independently, regardless of the environment, make decisions and follow their own choice. However, science says otherwise. Scientists say that we are most similar to those around us. For example, there is the famous study by Freemengham, which lasted 54 years. Scientists tracked the inhabitants of the city and observed their health and other indicators. It turned out that obesity is just the same epidemic, especially appearing in communities of people. Here are some numbers. If you have a complete friend, then the risk of obesity increases by 171%. If a woman\'s sister is overweight, then her risk of obesity increases by 67%. A man with a fat brother increases his risk of obesity by 45%. That is, the environment has a very specific influence on us, which can be calculated in numbers and their probability. Therefore, of course, you can do a dopamine reset, tune your hormonal system, tune yourself mentally and spiritually. But if around you are half people, half vegetables - this will affect your result. Moreover, people with weak willpower tend to shame others. And shame has a negative effect on the physiological aspects of discipline, as we discussed in previous lessons. And vice versa. If someone is proud of you and supports you in your endeavors, then this improves discipline. Therefore, it is critical to surround yourself with the right people. Find yourself someone who will support you on your journey. Research has been done. For example, one of these took place in Pittsburgh. The subjects were required to lose weight. Half of them were supported by a friend or close family member. Of those who were supported, 66% achieved their goal. Whereas the group without support finished only 24%. If you start to develop and move, being in a society of people who are not ready to support you, the process will go ten times more difficult. Some studies even say that social rejection affects the same brain regions as pain. And pain is bad. You don\'t want to create an association between discipline and pain, do you\? So find yourself people who will be for you with all hands. That is, they must be more or less developing people. As the Buddha said: we cannot change the people around us, but we can choose in whose environment we are. But here\'s the problem. How is it that a person who wants to develop and knows that in order to develop he needs to give up meeting those people who are dragging him down, still meets people who are dragging him down. Paradox. Now there will be a very tough example, about which I warn you in advance. But he clearly illustrates how everything happens. That\'s when a person in the family dies, because he has relatives, and they cry. Why are they actually crying\? They think that this person has finally died and that he is in an eternal void. They are absolutely sure of it. They think that this person is bad. Or they think that his time has not yet come, and he died too soon. In fact, a massive hole was formed in their soul, in their minds, with the departure of a certain person. There was a man, and there is no man. In its place was emptiness. The void is so big and powerful that it turns into a vacuum. She starts sucking everything in. This void needs to be filled urgently. But this is hard to do. And that\'s why a person walks with a hole in his soul, with a hole that has formed in his mind, and he does not know what to do with it. When parting with some friend, something similar happens to you, only less intensely. A hole is formed. There is a vacuum that cannot be filled. Suddenly, instead of walking and talking about nothing. We are left alone. Horrible thoughts are running through my head. Oh, I\'m antisocial, no one needs me, what to do now, and so on. The person begins to feel loneliness, a deep, all-consuming loneliness. And our consciousness does not want this to happen at all. It knows that if we remove all difficult, unnecessary friends from our lives, it will be painful and uncomfortable. So it will always resist. And even if you refuse them, it will try with all its might to find a replacement as soon as possible. This can be seen on failed pairs. So they sealed themselves with a short alliance, based on passion and instincts, they got used to each other. And as soon as a real relationship began, rejection immediately arises. The couple breaks up, but a vacuum appears. And now they are in a hurry to find a replacement. They find a replacement exactly the same, because they did not have time for introspection. By inertia, they run into the hands of the same relationship. And so it\'s all around. Why can’t you endure the spiritual emptiness that forms at the end of a relationship\? So what needs to be done so that when parting with the familiar environment there is no vacuum\? We need to make sure that the changes are not too powerful and stressful for our psyche. Therefore, there are four main principles of how to change the environment.\n""\n""The first principle is to know what you are looking for. Answer yourself a few questions. First: what kind of people will surround me\? What are their interests\? How do they look\? What are they thinking\? Second, what kind of people surround me now\? How does this environment fit my goals\? How far will I last if I leave everything unchanged. What kind of people should stay\? And with whom it is necessary to reduce communication to an absolute minimum\? And, finally, thirdly, what kind of person should I become so that there are people around me that I need. These questions are primary and must be asked before you move on to the second principle.\n""\n""The second principle is tact. Understand a simple thing everyone has a different development path. It\'s just that now your paths diverge. This is neither bad nor good. You just need to consider that no one is aware of your plans and does not understand why you are breaking up. Be as grateful as possible to these people for everything that binds you, but separate yourself from them carefully. First, you refuse to meet with them, coming up with a serious reason. Such a reason that it was clear and understandable to them. Secondly, create yourself a schedule so tight that you don\'t have time for the usual meetings with the old environment. Thirdly, at trainings, courses in the gym or anywhere else, find yourself a new successful friend, and then he will force out the old ones from your life. Fourth, a great way to get rid of the ballast is a dopamine reboot in the country, as I advise. When you leave for a long time, and you are forgotten a little. And after that, a long breakup will be easier for your former friends to accept. And finally, make sure that your environment gets rid of you. Start pushing new topics that they are simply not interested in. Show them that you are another person that they are not interested in.\n""The third principle is gradualism. So, if society plays a significant role in your life, you need to understand that a sharp refusal to meet with your environment will be stressful for the body. So that a vacuum of spiritual emptiness does not suddenly form in your life, all changes should be carried out slowly, gradually step by step, but if not slowly, then at least not too abruptly. Several times I have watched some of my acquaintances, in a rush to change the environment, get rid of a whole bunch of friends. And then they walked for six months with a sour face, not knowing what to do and suffer from loneliness. Of course, this is also the way. This can be done. But only if you feel the strength to do so.\n""Reducing time on social media can also help in this process. Start to gradually reduce unnecessary, routine and useless communication. Often a false, old, useless connection is maintained through the social media communication routine. You know, one writes to the other: Hello, How are you\? And he answers him: good. And the connection seems to be preserved. If you appear less and less on social networks, be sure that the offer to take a walk will decrease dramatically.\n""\n""And finally, the fourth principle is replacement. Be prepared for the fact that your time will suddenly start to free up, so you need to urgently find something to do. That\'s right, not another person. Do not ask for a meeting with a new worthy environment. No, you just need a case. A good, worthwhile job. You must become a self-sufficient person. You will start to have a whole bunch of free time, and you need to invest it somewhere. You can\'t just destroy something and put nothing in its place. Ideally, this is creativity, drawing, music, meditation, sports and so on. Whatever you like. Attention do not replace this time with things that you do not like. Let it be something that develops you as a person, some kind of hobby that will really develop your creative skills. What do you like to do\? If you don\'t know what you like to do, this is a great opportunity to find out. Try it. Make a list of interesting topics. And every month, try a new type of activity. Start going to different circles and sections, for example, yoga. Start going to the pool, walking in nature and so on. The main thing is to fill the resulting void in a timely manner."

    <string name="d11d1">"In this lesson, I will literally share with you one of the most powerful discoveries I have made for myself about self-discipline. We have already discussed the importance of sleep in the regulation of specific neurotransmitters. But now let\'s talk about what time you need to wake up and start your day. And science gives a clear answer. Early in the morning. Yes, you can be a night owl, but that doesn\'t mean you can\'t retrain yourself. It\'s very possible. There are only 10% true larks and 10% true owls. And everything else is something in the middle. Yes, indeed, there are three genes that are responsible for the fact that your body allegedly works better when waking up in the evening or in the morning. However, leading scientists believe that a simple habit can rewrite them. For example, sleep researcher Simon Richards believes that no matter who you are, an owl or a lark. With a simple habit, you can change who you are. In his words, genetics is not a sentence. You can follow your schedule and rewrite your genes. This is also confirmed by research. For example, in one of these studies, Owls and Larks were placed in the same environment in nature. A week later, their biological clocks equalized, and they acted equally effectively. Therefore, you don\'t have to be distracted. You are quite capable of getting up early. You just need to train yourself to get up early. This is really cool stuff. Before I tell you how this is related to the discipline, let\'s motivate you with other studies. For example, Larks appear to be less selfish and more tolerant of change. Whereas Owls are real daffodils. Early learners learn better, they are more active and achieve more success in life. And owls, meanwhile, are more prone to risk, including dangerous risks to life and even crime. And recent studies generally say that owls are more prone to psychopathy and mental health problems. Not surprisingly, owls have statistically less gray matter in the brain, which is responsible for communicating with different parts of the brain. Larks, on the other hand, are better able to deal with the negativity in their lives. They are more assertive about their goals and tend to have a more positive outlook on life. In short, I think I have motivated you well to get up early in the morning. However, I have not yet said anything about discipline. Well, in 2000, scientists found that those who wake up early in the morning procrastinate less, while Owls, on the contrary, tend to procrastinate more than other people. And in 2015, it became known that Larks are even more punctual than Owls. You will also be less prone to bad habits, and this brings us to an important conclusion. If you are a Lark, you have better self-discipline. I used to hate waking up early. I could sleep all morning and sometimes woke up even in the afternoon. However, at one point I decided to change my life. The first thing I decided to do was wake up at five every morning. The first thing I noticed was that everyone around was asleep. At this time, I had to do my own thing. No one writes messages on social networks and does not distract with conversations. So, I started waking up early, and I had about 2 hours free before everyone in the world starts waking up. I started meditating. Then, after a while, he added filling in his diary, came up with the morning ritual that we talked about earlier. Then my morning to-do list included exercising and stretching. Then I added a cold shower. I did all this, of course, gradually, not all at once. Also, 2 hours before everyone woke up, I already drank a liter of water and managed to write a page of my project. By the time my city opened its eyes, I had already worked out, meditated, took a cold shower, worked with the help of the morning ritual, tuned in to a powerful day and was ready to cheerfully get to work. Going out into the street, I saw sleepy faces. I was cheerful and powerful. In short, you probably already understood that I really liked waking up in the morning. Since then, I almost always wake up at 05:00 and do all the important things in the morning while others sleep. Now let\'s see where these two extra hours come from. I just go to bed earlier than others. Most people do nothing in the evening, just sit down at the computer in social networks and watch movies and just degrade. This is an absolute minority of the so-called creative people who can really create only at night. The rest of the people do almost nothing. I was one of those people who just does nothing, eats in the evening, consumes media, communicates with friends and, in fact, eats away at their lives. So I threw that garbage out of my life and just started going to bed at 9-10 pm. Yes, initially I tried to bring in some useful things for the evening and justify my not waking up in the early morning. But, unfortunately, nothing happened to me. It was not possible to maintain discipline, because in the evening you are usually tired, you do not want much, you are not charged and there is no motivation to do anything special. In the morning the situation is completely different. So that\'s why I recommend doing these things in the morning.\n""So, to my surprise, after about a couple of weeks, I began to sleep much better, because I went to bed at 9, at 10 and woke up at five. But that\'s not the whole surprise. From time to time I started waking up without an alarm at 05:00, without an alarm\! It was almost unreal. Especially in contrast to how it was before, when I got up at one in the afternoon and walked all day like boiled.\n""\n""So, the advantage of waking up early is the following. Firstly, you manage to do small things that an ordinary person cannot find time for. For example, meditation, cold shower, morning ritual, filling in a diary, creativity. By the way, about creativity. At one time I began to draw, then to write a book. While charging, I can listen to lectures, for example, on management or marketing. You can also go to social networks and reply to all incoming messages, while no one has woken up yet. And the second time to go only in the evening. Thus, you can easily wean yourself from social networks. And other people will also not get used to having an online dialogue, as they say. In short, at 2 o\'clock, it is in the morning that you can fit so many things that you will simply be amazed: how do you manage to do so much. What will it give you in terms of discipline\? You can do all the small things in the morning, and in the afternoon you can do the main work without being distracted by anything. Secondly, you will procrastinate less, you will be more socially adjusted, you will be less prone to bad habits and impulsive behavior, which in itself will increase discipline during the day. Thirdly, you will have more time. You will stop wasting time on empty things. Fourth, it will be easier for you to create the right sleep schedule. You will sleep better. Why don\'t most people get enough sleep\? Because they consider themselves supposedly Owls. How do they live\? They always go to bed at different times according to their mood. Not at one in the morning, neither at 12:00 nor at 11:00, but according to my mood. Therefore, their circadian rhythms go astray, and the body does not know exactly when to go to bed and when to produce hormones and, accordingly, their sleep rate is always knocked down. But, as you understand, it is high-quality full sleep that is the key to good neurotransmitters. By setting the right sleep schedule, you will no longer have to suffer from insomnia or lack of sleep. In short, I will speak from my own experience. Discipline became 1,000,000 times easier for me when I started waking up at the same time before other people and doing simple, routine, attuning activities while everyone was still sleeping. And I recommend the same to you. In a nutshell, I\'ll tell you how to switch to a new sleep mode. It took me about a month to do this. I started every day just going to bed 10 minutes earlier. I woke up on an alarm clock, after 8 hours of sleep through force. The first two weeks were tough. But then I gradually began to get used to it, and after a couple of months I generally began to fall asleep at 10:00, and wake up at five without an alarm clock. The main thing here is perseverance and constancy. Of course, there may be disruptions, but this is a temporary process. In general, I hope that this lesson will be useful to you. And I didn\'t hurt your feelings by saying all sorts of bad things about Owls. Everything, of course, is not as bad as it might seem, but really, for self-discipline, being a Lark is much better. So I strongly recommend this to you. And we move on to the next lesson."

    <string name="d11d2">"Now we will touch on a very interesting topic. In fact, it is quite banal, but you hardly suspected how much it affects self-discipline and self-control. Now we will talk about the variability of the heart rate. Heart rate variability is the ability of your system to rapidly change the rate of your heart rate. Well, let\'s imagine such a situation. For example, your friend suddenly jumped at you from around the corner and scared you a lot. At this point, the heart rate rises sharply. You are excited. If your heart rate variability is high, then you will quickly realize that it was a joke and your heart rate will quickly return to normal and you will no longer be stressed. If this indicator is low for you, your heart will be pounding for a long time, and you will be tense. In other words, heart rate variability is the ability of your body to adequately respond to events around you. This indicator affects almost everything in our lives, our mental, physical and mental health. But we are interested in something else, how this affects our self-discipline. So, scientists have found that the higher the variability of your heart rate, the more disciplined you are. And this indicator is so accurate that measuring it in a person can even predict how likely he is to succumb to temptation. I highly recommend this topic to anyone interested in health. But now I will only briefly tell you how to improve this indicator. By the way, you do not need to measure heart rate variability at all, although this can be done. Our task is not to know the numbers, but to be able to optimize them as much as possible. Fortunately, scientists have discovered a whole bunch of methods that optimize this indicator. These methods are quite trivial and simple, but it is in simplicity that the answers to the most difficult questions lie. All these methods are related to the health of our body as a whole.\n""\n""First, intermittent fasting, which I have already talked about in other lessons. Everything is simple here. In a day you give 16 hours, and in the remaining 8 hours you consume food. For example, here I eat three times. My first meal is at 10:00 am, the second at 2:00 pm. And the last time I eat at 17:00. So I fast for 16 hours a day. There are other ways to intermittent fasting. This is a longer hunger. For example, 24 hour fast once a week. But any type of intermittent fasting is a very good way to increase heart rate variability.\n""\n""Secondly, the quality of sleep, which I have already mentioned more than once in past lessons. The better the sleep, the better the heart rate variability. How to improve sleep\? Always go to bed and get up at the same time, sleep with constant access to fresh air, and also at a relatively low temperature. Preferably without a blanket. In addition, it is worth eating 4-5 hours before bedtime and not looking at any screens an hour before bedtime. And there is also an inverse relationship. The better the heart rate variability, the better the sleep.\n""\n""Thirdly, these are breathing exercises, yoga and our favorite meditation. All of these things have been scientifically proven to have a positive effect on heart rate variability. Yoga, for example, temporarily improves the indicators we need by 20%. Explore these things, of course, worth separate and independent. If you wanted to do yoga or breathing exercises, but did not know if it was worth it. Yes, it\'s worth it. From breathing exercises, you should pay attention to slow, conscious, calm breathing. We are interested in extended deep moderate breathing. It also makes sense to try breathing through one nostril. Don\'t know what it is\? I will leave a couple of links to YouTube videos so you can watch the technique. So, we have already talked about meditation, as I said, meditation is central to self-discipline. This is truly a unique instrument. Including it has a positive effect on the variability of the heart rate. This is confirmed by many studies. There are links to them, of course. All this can be combined with listening to classical music, which also improves heart rate variability in both men and women.\n""\n""Fourth, contrast procedures. Ideally, of course, this is a bath, after which you douse yourself with cold water. But you can do this in a simple soul.\n""\n""Fifth, proper nutrition. I have already said a lot about nutrition and I ask you to pay attention to the balance, omega three, omega six fatty acids. Omega three is widely known to have properties to improve heart rate variability. Research also shows that DHA  EPA supplemes (links to which I will leave below) improve heart rate variability. Look at the amount of vitamins and minerals consumed, remove all junk food. And in principle, for most people this will be enough.\n""\n""Six. Workout. But it\'s not all that simple. First, you need to pay attention to aerobic exercise. It is aerobic exercise that significantly improves heart rate variability. For example, long running or cycling or long swimming. In a word, a relatively light load stretched over time. Secondly, if you still prefer anaerobic exercise, then know that anaerobic exercise should be more frequent, but short - than rare, but voluminous. That is, it is desirable to lift heavy weights more often, but so that the training itself is short. Personally, I lift heavy weights several times a day, but my workouts last no more than 20 minutes. I have found that I recover faster and my strengths increase significantly. A huge amount of research finds that sport in principle, in any manifestation, reduces impulsiveness in decision-making. People start drinking less coffee, smoking less cigarettes, eating less sweets and automatically become more disciplined and so on. The largest medical analysis of all studies confirms that regular moderate exercise is not only a way to improve physical health, but one of the most important tools for development - self-discipline. And, for example, irregular exercise, on the contrary, is associated with a deterioration in self-discipline. In a word, a stable healthy lifestyle heals not only the body, but also the psyche.\n""\n""So, I have voiced six main activities that unrealistically raise the indicators of heart rate variability. So, it increases your ability to self-discipline. Proper nutrition, proper sports, contrast procedures, sleep patterns, intermittent fasting and meditation. Additional things that can be used are, for example, the supplement L - thionine. It is the active ingredient in green tea and improves heart rate variability. Walking in nature, which I mentioned in previous lessons, also has a very good effect on the indicators we need. For example, the well-known practice of Japanese forest breathing improves heart rate variability.\n""\n""Now I will talk about what lowers the variability of the heart rate.\n""\n""Our enemies are, first of all, stress. The more you stress, the worse it gets. How to deal with stress\? Again, meditation. And a well-tuned serotonin system. You should also eat foods high in antioxidants, such as berries.\n""\n""The second terrible enemy is overtraining. It\'s when you plow in the gym to such an extent that you barely come home. Do not do it this way. Yes, many fitness gurus recommend training in failure. But trust me, this is not the best option for your health and heart rate variability. Sports activities should be enjoyable for you. Training should end with a feeling of pleasant fatigue and even cheerfulness. Loads should give energy, and not squeeze you out like a lemon.\n""\n""The third enemy is alcohol and other drugs. Alcohol cuts heart rate variability down to zero. So even for the holidays, I do not recommend using this, if I may say so, product.\n""\n""The fourth enemy is procrastination. Studies show that procrastination significantly impairs heart rate variability, which also negatively affects heart rate variability and, consequently, self-discipline. Actually, poor sleep, poor diet and disease. Please note that you do not need to use squeezed oils. They are too high in omega six fatty acids. Focus on omega three fatty acids in walnuts or flaxseeds. I think we can end there. So, my dears, if you want to be a disciplined person, you will have to take care of your health. Everything in this world is interconnected. And even the health of the heart greatly affects self-discipline. Modern science is only getting closer to the secrets that our body hides. But even using these bits of knowledge, you can already significantly increase your efficiency. You used to think that bad discipline was the reason for your bad habits. And now you know that it\'s just the opposite. Slowly introduce the elements that I talk about in the tutorial. And one day you will come to the ideal discipline, while simultaneously improving your health."

    <string name="d11d3">"You have probably noticed many times that the longer you work, the harder it is to work. You start to get annoyed, you want to relax, eat something, get distracted, and so on. Scientists are also finding that the longer a work blog lasts, the more impulsive decisions a person makes. No wonder. This happens everywhere and all the time. For example, the researchers conducted an experiment, divided the subjects into two groups. The first group was forced to solve a complex mathematical problem. The other one just didn\'t do anything. Then everyone was asked to choose between a fat cake and an apple. Those who solved the problem were more likely to choose the cake. This means that preliminary mental stress, as it were, consumes a certain resource of self-discipline. You kind of know that the cake is bad. You know you have to pick an apple, but you pick a cake anyway. And there were a lot of such studies on different population groups, at different ages in different scenarios. But the result is always the same. If you use willpower, then you seem to be wasting a certain resource. As a result, it is more difficult for you to maintain self-discipline. And scientists have been studying this question for a long time: What kind of resource is this and how to replenish it\? From the book “The Hour Between Dog and Wolf” by John Kotz, I first learned that this resource is glucose. Of course, I\'m generalizing now. Willpower is a much more complex issue than just glucose. But it turns out that it really does have a huge impact on our self-discipline. It seems that the act of self-control depletes large resources of glucose in the blood, and in our system as a whole.\n""\n""In fact, any mental activity drives more glucose from the blood and liver into the brain. Despite the fact that the brain weighs only 2% of the total body weight, it spends as much as 20% of all daily energy. And it is the act of self-discipline and self-control, the act of deliberately depriving oneself of something, that consumes a large amount of sugar. For the first time in 2007, scientists conducted an experiment. The subjects were divided into two groups. One group of subjects was given regular lemonade, and the other lemonade with sugar, and their concentration was measured during a complex mental task. The results were clear. Those who drank sweet lemonade retained the best concentration. They were able to work longer and were less prone to impulsive decisions. Then another group of physiologists from the University of Florida measured the level of glucose in the brain and found that during complex mental tasks, glucose stores were depleted and this reduced the body\'s ability to control itself. Scientists sum up: the distribution of energy plays an important role in self-discipline. The link between the level of glucose available to the brain explains why willpower is a finite resource. This explains why hunger makes us more hasty and impulsive. And this is a very serious moment. For example, we conducted a study of judges during sentencing. It turned out that if the judge had just eaten, then only 20% of the suspects he found guilty. If he is very hungry, then 90% will be found guilty. In other words, a hungry judge almost always thinks inadequately and impulsively. And another method analysis of eight studies clearly shows how hunger affects our ability to self-control. So what should be done\? You need to eat right, consistently, on schedule. And in such a way that our brain always has available glucose. Optimal performance is when you have high insulin sensitivity and when there is consistently low blood sugar in your blood. And when your body in any situation can take the sugar available in its reserves and use it for its own needs, whether it be physical exercises or mental stress. What does this mean for us\? This means eating less refined sugar and less isolated fat. Surprise, right\? I talk about this all the time. So I won’t go into more detail, not about this training. However, here are a few rules to repeat. The most detrimental thing, perhaps, is sugar with fat. For example, cake or chocolate or chips. In a word, all the joys of the modern food industry, it is desirable to avoid foods with a high glycemic index and a high glycemic load. I will give a table below the lesson. The higher the glycemic index of a food, the faster it raises blood sugar levels. After that, the opposite usually happens, a sharp drop in blood sugar levels and, as a result, a decrease in pancreatic function. I understand that those who are not familiar with the topic have a hard time understanding what it is about. Therefore, I can only give a tip, because just telling how everything works is not an easy task. So study, firstly, the topic of separate nutrition. Try not to mix carbohydrates with fat. And do not eat the so-called food sold in packages. These are all the same chips, snickers and chocolates, buns, semi-finished products and all that.\n""\n""Secondly, follow a strict diet. These are the basic requirements. Of course, you can give 1000 more recommendations about blood sugar levels. But even if I wanted to, I couldn\'t put them here. At the moment I have more than 20 pages of scientific text, where almost every sentence is supported by scientific research. I will present this information in a different format. As part of this training, understand a simple thing: try to avoid foods with a high glycemic index, and also eat fat separately from carbohydrates. Moreover, fats must be natural. Try not to use oils. So, now that we\'ve got the basics out of the way, another interesting recommendation can be made. If you work for a long time and start to feel irritated, then eat something sweet. But it doesn\'t have to be refined sugar. It is best that it be some kind of fruit. Use natural products. The foods your body is used to. From all this thinking about blood sugar, one more important clarification needs to be made. Modern Western culture promotes gluttony. This is also not necessary. No need to overeat to such an extent that after eating you want to lie down and relax, soak up the couch. If you feel this way, know that you are eating too much. Or the food you have eaten is too heavy for you. There needs to be a balance here. Leaving the table, according to Japanese tradition, you need to be 20% hungry. In this case, you will be enough for a long job, and you will not be put to sleep. Another point that we have already discussed with you is intermittent fasting. Surprisingly, intermittent fasting helps to avoid starvation. Paradox\? Not really. Intermittent fasting improves sugar sensitivity. And as a result, your body makes better use of glucose.\n""\n""So, let\'s sum up this lesson. Willpower is a finite resource. It relies heavily on available glucose for the brain to get the glucose it needs. It is advisable not to skip meals, while observing intermittent fasting. And with especially intensive work, you can eat fruit. How will this help your self-discipline\? Well, in the habit-forming phase, you have to force yourself to do things you don\'t want to do, and that wastes a lot of personal resources. So, having this tool, you will be able to fill the missing resource to some extent. However, do not get carried away with snacks. It shouldn\'t become a habit. Use them only in extreme situations. Your main weapon is proper nutrition. See\! The further we go, the more arguments in favor of a healthy lifestyle. The healthier you lead, the better your self-discipline. And this is an absolutely proven scientific fact. So do not neglect these data, eat properly, stably, play sports and breathe air. All this contributes significantly to the self-discipline that we all so desire."

    <string name="d11d4">"What could be worse for our self-discipline than social networks, pornography, sweets and casinos\? It\'s hard to imagine, but there is such a thing. Horror. I\'m not just talking about horror movies now, it\'s a more general term. For example, modern news is sheer horror: somewhere someone was killed, someone was stabbed to death, there is corruption, there are uprisings, here taxes are raised. You turn off the TV, go outside, and people around repeat everything they heard on TV and in YouTube trends. Finally, you go to the cinema and there you will see continuous scenes of murders that have already become familiar. Everywhere one continuous horror. If you think about it more deeply, we live in constant fear. For example, most people walk with slightly raised shoulders and tense muscles. Their thoracic region is typically tucked into a semi-boxing posture. All these are typical signs of constant chronic fear. And even if we put on a mask of joy, our whole body is tense. From this endless stress pouring from the screens and from the mouths of people, we do not pay attention to the beauty of the trees and the singing of birds. Our reflexes are intense. Okay, you can describe all this for a long time, but I will only drive you into even more horror. This is not my goal. I\'d rather talk about what all this is fraught with. Scientists have done a lot of research on this topic. For example, two groups of people were shown different movies. The first group was shown a scene from the 1979 film Champion. A man was killed there, and the scene lasted for about a few minutes. The second group was shown a short documentary. So, those who watched the horror scene, the murders, on average paid three times as much for things that they do not need. The thing is that any horrors, visual, audio or whatever, cause impulsive behavior in us. Horrors give rise to animals, instincts in us, they force us to accumulate resources with all our might and save our lives at any cost. And, of course, we want quick profits. That\'s why people who stew in the negative buy so much garbage. They are usually more selfish and see the catch in everything. Needless to say, this is very bad for self-discipline\? I think no. We have seen many times that impulsiveness does not go well with discipline. Probably one of the biggest pieces of advice I can give is to get out of the loop of negativity by paying attention to the other side of life. We do not see it simply because we are looking in the wrong direction. Do not go to YouTube trends, do not turn on the news, do not watch political programs, do not watch scary movies, do not play horror and horror games on the computer. And most importantly, stop communicating with those people who do all this."

    <string name="d11d5">"If you have read the previous parts of the lesson, then you are probably already tired of hearing about meditation. But for some reason, despite the fact that I talk a lot about meditation, no one does it. Paradox, right\? People think it\'s some kind of joke or it\'s not serious. No, friends, in this tutorial, I have demonstrated five critical points on which meditation will help you gain discipline. This is the restoration of the dopamine system, and the restoration of serotonin, this is accelerated neurogenesis and improved neuroplasticity. This is improved heart rate variability. And finally, awareness, which is the crown of discipline. The funny thing is that this action is so simple and enjoyable that it is a pleasure to do it. It improves the quality of life so much that I resent it when people don\'t take it seriously. Therefore, I ask you, friends, it was not in vain that I mentioned meditation so many times, do it\! After all, I could devote just a couple of lines to this and say: Well, yes, meditation is useful. And some of the recommendations in my training are exactly the same, as if not mandatory. But as far as meditation is concerned, it is a must. For clarity, let me illustrate how mindfulness works. Let\'s do an experiment. For example, you are walking down the street and you feel thirsty. There is a kiosk nearby. You can buy bad soda, or you can buy water. Before you make a choice, dive into your emotions, try to understand what makes you want a soda. The answer will come pretty quickly: I want soda because it tastes good. It doesn\'t quench my thirst, but I\'m used to buying soda. So now I want it again. It is much more reasonable to buy water. After all, I want to quench my thirst, not stuff myself with sugar. Now, after such reflection, it is much easier to make a useful choice. The thing is that we do everything harmful on the machine, on autopilot, by inertia. The main driver of harmful decisions is emotions. The algorithm here is simple: We see some possibility or object. Next comes the emotional reaction. And in the wake of this emotional reaction, we make a harmful decision. Well, for example, you saw an advertisement for Coca-Cola somewhere. She began to be associated with fun and joy at the level of subconscious - emotional reactions. And do not think that advertising does not work for you. Also how it works. Otherwise, people would not spend millions of dollars on it. Advertising works, period. Therefore, when you see a bottle of Coca-Cola, a subconsciously emotional reaction is triggered, and you thoughtlessly give money for one of the most harmful drinks of our time. But intervening in this sequence with the powers of the mind, you disrupt the entire algorithm. That is, you see soda - an emotional reaction happens. But as soon as you consciously look at this soda, throwing emotions aside, you see the real picture, and not a curtain of subconscious installations. This is called consciousness. Consciousness is the ability to impartially look at what is happening to you in any situation. Consciousness is something that they try to pull out of us in every possible way. Advertising is based on emotions. Movies are also made this way, relying on emotional manipulation. Yes, even in the world of politics, no one operates at the level of real accurate data. We tend to give in to emotions in all areas of life. No one in the modern world will encourage your consciousness. No one needs you to interfere with the well-oiled mechanism of manipulation. So you have to do everything yourself. And meditation does just that. I\'ll explain how. The essence of meditation is that you begin to draw attention to yourself. Let\'s say concentration on the breath. You sit down and pay close attention to how you breathe. Inhale exhale, inhale exhale.\n""So, within 10 minutes. If you have not meditated before, thoughts will constantly interfere with the surveillance process: What about exams\? And where to get money\? and so on. You gently move these thoughts forward and bring your attention back to your breath. So, from time to time. Hundred times. You will very quickly realize that such a simple thing as watching your breath is not so simple, but this is consciousness. Consciousness is the ability to independently control where your attention is directed. The more you meditate, the easier it is to control your attention. In general, think, if it’s so hard for you to follow your breathing while sitting in a comfortable chair, then how convenient it is in comparison with this to track your emotions when you see some kind of product or if you want to eat something harmful. Much harder. However, a person who meditates frequently can, at will, direct his attention to any point in his consciousness. Meditation is a kind of training ground. During meditation, we practice our skill of introspection. Here is a steadily meditating person passing Coca-Cola. It is very easy for him to look at himself from the outside and see: Yeah, now I am experiencing an emotion, but this is not desirable, and then bring my consciousness to the level of the mind: So now I will buy water, and this will be the right choice, what a good fellow I am\! I control myself.\n""\n""In the modern world, this is also called emotional intelligence - the ability to recognize your emotions. The relationship between emotional intelligence and self-discipline has long been known in the scientific community. This is reflected in the results of the students. Tom Miller wrote an entire book on the subject, Self-Discipline and Emotional Control, which I recommend to all of you.\n""\n""The meditating person does this automatically. It\'s easier for him to control himself. How does this relate to self-discipline\? I think it\'s understandable. Discipline - especially at the stage of developing a habit - is when you give up one in favor of another. You can refuse something only if you are able to consciously look at your own internal emotional reactions: So, now I want to play computer games. This is inappropriate\! The mere fact that you intervened with your mind in a spontaneous, programmed process will allow you to abandon the idea MUCH easier.\n""\n""Meditation is very different. You can direct your attention to the sensations in your body, to the relaxation of muscle spasms. You can pay attention to the world around you, to your position in space. You can observe the flow of your thoughts, trying not to hang on it. You can even meditate while dancing, trying to be as focused as possible on sensations and relaxation. In a word, meditation can be very different, but its essence is always the same. Learn to manage your attention. And the longer you meditate, the easier it is for you to give up emotional decisions, from programmed, subconscious attitudes. In short, you become more aware. In our program - meditation has a central role, do not neglect this powerful tool. It\'s not for nothing that I put it so high. It should also be said that meditation itself activates the areas of the brain responsible for willpower. The more often we activate these areas, the greater their activity. In short, I mean that everything I\'m talking about is not taken from the ceiling. This is real scientific data. Also, hormonal responses to the process of meditation are also very useful for building good habits. In general, meditation is a very big topic, but now you should know one thing - it is an indispensable tool for self-discipline. Enough even 10 - 20 minutes of meditation a day. I prefer early morning. I hope I was able to convince you. And with that I end the lesson."

    <string name="d12">"Greetings, friends. In this last big lesson, we will summarize all the most important results of the theoretical material that we have studied. Let\'s collect them in the general concept of behavior. We will also draw up a kind of template of actions that will allow you to restore all the mechanisms on which self-discipline and willpower depend.\n""\n""First, three important points that you need to directly “feel”. First, in order to develop self-discipline, you must first get rid of harmful behavior. Not only is bad willpower the cause of harmful behavior, but the harmful behavior itself is the cause of poor self-discipline. Self-discipline is almost entirely dependent on how we perform on a daily basis, what we eat, what we think, where we look and so on. Therefore, in order to adjust willpower, you first need to radically change your own behavior. Unfortunately, there is no other way.\n""\n""Secondly, self-discipline is needed only once in order to accustom yourself to new lines of behavior. Discipline is just a matter of habit. Get used to work and you will be uncomfortable fooling around. You get used to playing the fool and you will be uncomfortable with discipline. Habit.\n""\n""Thirdly, you need to understand and remember literally always that it is every day that self-discipline frees you. It is not a burden or a cage. These are the most powerful free will boosters you can find. At first, while you are not yet the most disciplined person in the world and have not had time to feel all the goodies of good self-discipline, you just need to remember this, try to convince yourself of this, so that it is easier to maintain discipline. But then, the more you begin to feel the advantages of such a lifestyle, the more free time, money, knowledge, strength and health you have, the more independent and calm you become, the brighter and clearer this truth will become manifest. Discipline brings freedom. And one day it will become an indisputable truth for you. You will laugh at the miserable, confused lifestyle you once had. But, as I said, for the first couples, it is advisable to just remember this. Especially in difficult times.\n""\n""So, now let\'s start collecting the data that I presented in the previous lessons. It is necessary to arrange all this somehow, to compose it into some kind of general system, at least in general terms. Let\'s go through the most important, because it can be applied in practice. First, we set up the environment. So, the environment affects us the wildest. I think I proved this thesis well during my studies. For example, moving into a new apartment, everyone feels like starting a new life. It feels like everything has changed, everything can be changed. It is for this reason that people love to travel away from home so much. It refreshes perception, displaces stereotypes. You start behaving differently. For many, even after a vacation, posture, tone of voice, facial expression, habits, and so on temporarily change. In a word, simply by changing the world around you, you can change a lot in your behavior, but, as I explained, it is quite possible to put your own meanings into the outside world. It is not necessary to travel 5000 kilometers for this. For example, coming home, seeing a computer and a comfortable chair, our body, remembering the previous experience, relaxes in advance, preparing for the fact that you will now collapse into this chair and watch a funny video. This happens simply because we have accustomed our body to react in a certain way to certain external stimuli. Look, for example, around you. How, for example, does the door of the room you are in now affect you\? This door triggers a whole series of unconscious reactions in you. Someone, say, may be at work, and this nasty door may disgust him, and someone may be sitting with his beloved grandmother in the apartment, and the wooden Soviet door, smelling of old books, causes pleasant warmth at the mere glance of it. One thing is important here: we ourselves put different meanings into these doors, and this should be used in the formation of self-discipline. The problem is that it is very difficult to rewrite meaning on old environmental objects, since associations have been developed over the years, they are extremely strong. Therefore, I would recommend that you change the surrounding space as much as possible, rearrange the furniture, throw away old things, remove excess out of sight, put new books on the shelves and remove old ones from them, hang motivating posters, lay a carpet. Or if there is already a carpet, then turn it over so that the pattern under your feet is different. In a word, to modify the familiar environment in which you live as much as possible. In the training, I explain that when you go home on the first couples, you will be at a loss, your body will not know how to behave. And this is the very time in which the old stereotypes of behavior are being rewritten. It is during this period of familiarization with the new environment that you should accustom yourself to new habits as much as possible. And how to do this, we will discuss further. Of course, as I said, the environment needs to be changed not only at home, but also at school or at work, if possible. Even in small things. Put, for example, a pencil case with stationery at the other end of the table, sit on another desk or chair, buy other stationery than usual, and so on. You can also change the way home and get used to the new way. And while you get used to this new way, you can accustom yourself to new thoughts at the same time. When walking down a new road, always think about what could potentially be useful to you. For example, I have two key turning points in my daily walk. When I turn for the first time, I am immediately reminded of the project and how I could improve it further. This thought seems to appear automatically at the level of reflexes. My body is used to thinking about the project - and it does. The second turn signals that the time has come for me to engage in the mindfulness practice that I talked about in the training. Well, or meditation in action. And so you can program absolutely any space, any path, any algorithm, anything. In a word, I strongly advise you to use the way the world around you influences you. Moreover, I will say that this is one of the most powerful tools to modify self-discipline and your habits. Teach your body to tune in to work, and not to relax with computer games. Train him in the store to go to the fruit and vegetable section first, and not to the confectionery section. Teach him on the way home to think about what is really useful, and not about some kind of politics. And, finally, to teach him to observe discipline, and not to play the fool.\n""\n""Secondly, we set up the power supply.\n""I will be very short and concise. All the details are in the previous lessons. First, we remove sugar and isolated fat. That is, sauces, buns, bread. As an exception, only sourdough bread is allowed. We remove sweets, ice cream, cookies, sugar, sweeteners, energy drinks, sodas, sports bars, yogurts, vegetable oils, it is also desirable to remove and replace them with fats and from some whole foods, for example, from avocados, nuts and golden seeds, for example . Next, follow the diet. It is advisable to have time to place all meals in about a 10 hour window. This mode is suitable for almost everyone. And the remaining 14 hours a day do not eat at all, but only drink water. In extreme cases, drink a decoction. Go ahead. Toward evening, it is advisable not to eat animal products rich in protein. It is advisable to use them in the morning. Further, it is advisable to stick to plant foods for the most part. At the same time, do not forget to properly make a diet. It is very important to eliminate as much as possible all foods with a high glycemic index. A detailed table can also be found online. Preference should be given to berries, fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, mushrooms and spices. These foods should be taken in their unprocessed, natural form. It is advisable to cook everything yourself. It should, like fire, avoid processed foods. These are, for example, flour, bread, sugar, butter, roasted nuts, nuggets, french fries, chips, cereals, burgers, sausages, sausages, muesli, muffins, all kinds of chilled teas from stores, popcorn and more.\n""\n""We go further. What should definitely be added to the diet: foods rich in tyrosine and tryptophan, in which the ratio of these amino acids in relation to other amino acids is very high.\n""\n""Such foods are mainly legumes, i.e. lentils and beans, pseudocereals, i.e. buckwheat, quinoa and millet, as well as seeds, i.e. sesame and pumpkin seeds. After eating foods rich in tyrotophane and tyrosine, after an hour or two, it is advisable to eat something carbohydrate, a light snack type, for example, fruit. Banana or avocado is very good for this. Definitely, you should pay attention to the amount of antioxidants in the diet. For this, berries and spices are suitable.\n""\n""Next, I will remind you a little about decoctions. Once a week you need to drink a mug of each of the decoctions. There are only three of them: St. John\'s wort, Rhodiola rosea, and ginseng. I personally drink them on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings.\n""\n""Let\'s continue with additions. The supplements I recommend using on a daily basis are vitamin B12 and vitamin D3, omega three fatty acids, turmeric, broccoli sprouts. Or if you are too lazy to grow broccoli sprouts yourself, although I strongly advise you, then you can buy sulforaphane separately. Then minced ginger, onion and garlic. Supplements that can be used temporarily or in courses are barberine, burning mucuna, argan oil, beta-alanine and ginkgo biloba. I will leave links to all supplements below. Usually I order from iHerb, respectively, and the links will be there. But you can also find the whole thing on amazon. It\'s there too. It\'s probably all about food. The only thing on my own behalf, I will add a recommendation that it is desirable to eat at the table, paying attention to the taste of food and enjoying its appearance.\n""This is the practice of mindfulness, the benefits of which for self-discipline we have talked about quite a bit. Of course, this is very difficult to achieve in the first couples, but you can start with at least one meal a day and gradually reach all meals in a conscious state.\n""\n""Thirdly, we deal with the schedule. And there will be a lot of points here, because the schedule means a lot. Depending on how well a person knows me, it may seem to him that I am either very busy or doing nothing at all. Someone who doesn\'t know me well can see that I\'m rarely available and very, very, very productive. I mean, I do a lot of things. And he concludes that I must be very busy. If a person knows me well, most likely, he is surprised how I manage to do everything, while doing nothing. But this happens because I have a very clear schedule. I am already bringing the main block of cases to an end, when people are just starting to accelerate. Every day from 5:30, or even from 5:00 to 7:30, I work very intensively on the most urgent and important matters, without being distracted by anything. Then I eat, go to school, resting at the same time, and then I arrange an even more intense race in the second block of work already at school. But the funny thing is that my body has no variability. He knows very clearly when and how to give all the best, and when to rest. During the months of the same stable schedule, he became very clear about when he needed to wake up, when he needed to plow. And, perhaps, it was (I repeat) solely because of the schedule. Despite the fact that in total at work, I, like everyone else, spend from 7 to 10 hours, from the outside it may seem that I am constantly walking, eating or exercising. But in fact, I just very clearly separate work and leisure. I do not have a stretched concept of a working day, but there is a very specific time frame in which I work every day without exception. From 5:30 to 7:30, from 8:30 to 16:30 - 17:00 lessons, from 19:00 to 21:00. Most people work in approximately the same mode, but due to the blurring of the scope of rest and work periods, they do not have time to either work normally or relax. Uncertainty allows your body to do all sorts of stupid things.\n""\n""Think when you don\'t have to think, and play the fool when you have to work. Work when you need to rest and so on. Therefore, an ideal schedule is the first step towards a clear self-discipline. The sooner your body learns when to push, when to rest, when to eat, when to exercise, and when to sleep, the better. Don\'t give him a choice of what to do for a second. As soon as your brain has a choice, it chooses social networks instead of reading books, watching TV shows instead of exercising, and playing computer games instead of the work block. Moreover, at the moment of rest, he may suddenly think that the time has come for him to work, he will wake up with inspiration, and he will decide that it is urgently time to write some text or do homework. So how should you make a schedule\? Here, of course, everyone\'s schedule will be different. Someone study at home, and someone goes to school every day for 3 hours. But there is one clear principle. Clarity and certainty in wording and time frames. For example, not just go in for sports, but very clearly: at 16:00 I have five minutes to get in shape and change clothes, 10 minutes to get to the gym, 40 minutes of training, in which there are four sets for each muscle group, 12 repetitions in each set and a minute and a half rest between sets. Approximately like this. You can\'t let your feelings go. There should be a very clear schedule that you don\'t have to think about at all. It just is, and it just needs to be done, nothing to think about and nothing to change unnecessarily, because, strictly speaking, this training is not entirely about productivity. I will not talk about time management tools, scheduling and all that in a fairly deep form. But let\'s move on, because the schedule, as I said at the beginning, is a very broad concept. For example, there should be a schedule of progress in a particular case. When I go to training, I know for sure that today I will add to the barbell, let\'s say, five extra pounds. If I add 10 or 20 kilograms, I risk injury. Therefore, my training process is known in advance. I have a notebook in which I clearly write down how many sets, reps, weights and so on I need to add. So, in the formation of discipline, there should also be gradualness. As I said, at the beginning of the course, jumpiness is our enemy. Of course, you can take on more weight than you should, and maybe even push 10 times. But because of this, your arms, back and ligaments will suffer. You don\'t have to take on a lot of things. They need to be introduced gradually. For example, now I have three working blocks every weekend. Cold shower, workout, walk, meditation, stretching, breathing practice, reading a book and even chatting with friends on social networks. But I went to this final kind of routine for about a year, without exaggeration. And I started with a very simple activity. I only had one work block and a walk. Then I added morning meditation. Got used to it, then added a workout got used to it. Added another working block. And at first this working block was very short, then it became more and more. Then I added stretching to my morning meditation, then a cold shower, and so on. This process took a very long time, but each of these habits was literally developed in my brain to such an extent that now it is almost impossible to erase it. It\'s like a brand, like an instinct. It\'s like brushing your teeth. It cannot be removed from life. Again, I will give an analogy with the hall. When I first started training, my maximum repetitions for pull-ups were 10 - 12. Now I am warming up with this weight, that is, my second approach is already this weight. All why\? Because I allowed my body to adapt to the load, and for a long time I went to such strength indicators. Graduality is very important. Add well-tuned dopamine and serotonin to your gradualness, add a perfectly tuned environment that makes you want to be productive. And here is a template for forming good habits.\n""\n""But let\'s continue. After all, again, write-off is a loose concept. It is very important to follow the schedule in the cycles of each individual case. Every business must have four phases. And this schedule is inside each case. The first phase is the CLUE. That is, each case has a certain clue in the form of time or environment. For example, the lead is morning, bedroom. The second phase, goal setting. For example, now I will meditate and I will feel perfect. The third phase is the DOING, for example, meditation. And finally, the fourth phase is the reward. For example, a pleasant feeling of relaxation in the body. Let\'s substitute this template for something else. Let\'s say a trigger or a hook is an evening, an armchair. Intention and goal setting: I will now read 40 pages. The thing is reading. The reward is a walk in the evening city and communication with good friends. I think the principle is clear. This is the most basic and necessary principle of habit formation. Apply this to all the things you want to keep in your life and they will stay in your life. But let\'s continue because the schedule is a loose concept. This includes life cycles, such as sleep schedules. There is a separate lesson about this, but I will remind you anyway. It is ideal to wake up early in the morning and fall asleep early in the evening. Owls are bad at self-discipline mainly because they don\'t have a well-defined sleep schedule. Theoretically, you can stay up late. For example, if the Owl man fell asleep every time at one in the morning, there would be much less problems. But owls don\'t have a sleep schedule. They lie down at random, all the time at different times. Consequently, they always feel differently, wake up at different times, always have a different hormonal background, no stability and, of course, no self-discipline. Being a Lark in the sense of self-discipline is much much more beneficial. I think I said everything about the schedule. Let me summarize.\n""\n""A clear schedule with specific time-limited tasks, a sleep schedule, and a gradual development are the key to stable willpower.\n""\n""Fourth, there are some very important life hacks for self-discipline. Let me remind you of them. There are special things that wildly charge with the potential of willpower. Briefly, these are meditation, mindfulness practice, walks in nature, interaction with the sun, massage and contrast showers. Truly each of these items is a crazy tool if used on a consistent basis. And this is the key point on a “permanent basis”. I would probably start with meditation and walking in the sun, as it is the easiest and most powerful thing to experience. And then I would start introducing more complex and less pleasant practices, for example, the practice of awareness. This is when you brush your teeth in the morning with your left hand or actively try not to say a word.\n""This includes the practice of active meditation I mentioned. But, as I said, try everything in order. Don\'t push yourself with a bunch of tools at once. Feel each one. Find out which suits you best\! Set aside time for it in your daily schedule and set up the environment for it, get used to it. And only then move on to the next practice.\n""\n""Fifth, constant introspection. During the training, I gave quite a few tools for this. For example, morning and evening rituals, the elements of which, by the way, like all the other tools that I have given, are scientifically proven to improve self-discipline. Let me remind you what they are. In the morning we wake up and set specific goals, but in the context of our life we \u200B\u200Btry to understand what will be done today and how it all fits into our goals, our understanding, our concept of life. Why are we doing all this and how does all this affect us and the world around us\? After we have replayed the upcoming day in our head, thanked nature for the opportunity to live, we proceed to the daily routine. Well, in the evening, evening ritual. It is designed to track what you did wrong during the day. Where did you make a mistake, where did you fail, where could you have done better. Having understood your jambs, it is very important to accept them and reprogram yourself for new behavior. We imagine how we will behave when a similar situation occurs again. This often happens during meditation. We imagine the future situation in colors: what we experience in it, where we will go, what we will say, what we will do, what we will think about, and so on. The practice of the morning and evening ritual allows us to notice the subtlest mistakes in our behavior and correct them. Often we do self-analysis at best once every five years. Well, if you do this every day, then you can see such subtle processes and adjust them so subtly and ultimately achieve ideal behavior. Again, this practice has been scientifically proven to work. In addition to the rituals for analysis, I gave other tools. For example, the memory that you may die the next moment, as well as the daily reflection on the meaning of what you are doing.\n""\n""And, finally, the last sixth point is the principle of life “purity”. Purity in everything: in the environment, in the food you eat, in the information you consume, in the things you spend time on. Every aspect of life should be in full view. Everything should be visible and crystal clear. It should be absolutely clear to you, personally to you: Why are you doing this\? Where are you doing it\? when do you do it\? If something is suddenly unclear, remove the excess, simplify, reorganize and try to understand again. Discipline is impossible without a clear vision of how your work is organized. It is very important not to constantly violate your life frame with all sorts of rubbish. No need to burden yourself with meaningless relationships. You don\'t need to cram food into yourself that won\'t do you any good. No need to sit on social networks, because this is some kind of incomprehensible activity. All the most important things will find their way into your life if you do not clog it with all sorts of dirt. Reduce stress if it can be reduced. For example, you do not need to look at the news if your work is not related to it. There\'s no need to watch YouTube if it doesn\'t help you get better. There is no need to communicate with people who spend all their energy pouring hackneyed political information into each other\'s ears. In short, it is important to maintain hygiene. Not only body hygiene, but also time, consciousness, space and deeds.\n""\n""Well, here are six of the most important practical points, each of which has been scientifically proven to be effective for self-discipline and willpower. I want to add only one thing: it is important to use them constantly. It\'s not something that starts working overnight. These things will not be able to turn your life over in a second, but for two or three months, stable compliance with these conditions. And you will begin to notice how your willpower becomes really strong. How do you manage to do everything that needs to be done, how books are read, things get done, lessons end, relationships improve, and meaning is strengthened. Despite the simplicity of these solutions, it will not be easy to implement them, but with a gradual, constant and competent approach, with the desire and due perseverance, you will definitely succeed\!\n""\n""Thank you for reading this tutorial to the end. I really hope that you were interested to know what I told you. I want to believe that my work will be useful to you, that you have discovered something new for yourself\! Perhaps they learned something more about themselves or discovered some gateways for self-development. The rest is in your hands\!"
